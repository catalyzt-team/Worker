# Worker

Worker dynamically imports and executes TypeScript files from the `src/scripts` directory with CRON Job set up and serve them as Static API or JSON Objects.

## Project Structure

- `src/scripts`: This directory contains the TypeScript files to be executed. Each file should export a `run` function that returns the data to be written to the JSON output file.
- `app.ts`: This is the main file that imports and executes the TypeScript files.
- `output.json`: This file is generated by `app.ts` and contains the output of the `run` function from the last TypeScript file that was executed.
