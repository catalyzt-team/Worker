{"name":"hildobby's Dune dashboards","description":"This project includes various Dune dashboards I have created as a contribution to the Optimism ecosystem. I have also recently created an open source wash trades filtering method that can be used on Optimism NFT trade data. I intend to share more methods like this one going forward which will be usable on Optimism data within Dune and open sourced so it can easily be ported out of Dune.","category":"Education"}
