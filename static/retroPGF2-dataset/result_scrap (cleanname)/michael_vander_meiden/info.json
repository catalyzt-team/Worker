{"name":"Michael Vander Meiden","description":"My work for the Optimism Collective falls into two categories: * 1st is my volunteer contributions to Optimism Governance, mainly planning, hosting, and recapping the bi-weekly governance calls. * 2nd is my youtube channel, 'The Blockchain Guy', making hype-free & high-quality educational content focused on the Optimism and Ethereum ecosystems.","category":"Education"}
