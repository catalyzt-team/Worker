{"name":"Frame","description":"Frame is a web3 platform that creates a secure, system-wide interface to your chains and accounts, giving any browser, command-line, or native application the ability to access web3. Our routing architecture, Omnichain, simplifies the user experience by eliminating the concept of \"being on a chain\" and allowing dapps to route requests to any of the user's available chains in parallel.","category":"Tooling and utilities"}
