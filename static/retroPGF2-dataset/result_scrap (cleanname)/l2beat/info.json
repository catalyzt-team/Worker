{"name":"L2BEAT","description":"L2BEAT is an Ethereum Layer Two (L2) scaling analysis and research website. We compare Ethereum L2s by monitoring their usage & TVL-related metrics, verifying their documentation against the source code, and manually assessing associated risks. We have created a risk framework for L2s and bridges, along with open-source monitoring tools that check for changes in their smart contracts' parameters.","category":"Education"}
