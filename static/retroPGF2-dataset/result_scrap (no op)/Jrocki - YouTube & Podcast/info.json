{"name":"Jrocki - YouTube & Podcast","description":"I have my YouTube Channel containing Optimism only content including a tutorial series for the Optimism Quests. In addition, I co-host a weekly Twitter space for the Optimism community which began as an Optipunk's NFT community call. When a project joins us the space is recorded and posted on an RSS feed known as \"The Web3 Experience\" podcast. Analytics: https://bit.ly/3KoGJGu","category":"Education"}
