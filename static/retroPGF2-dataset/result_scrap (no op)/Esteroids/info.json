{"name":"Esteroids","description":"Esteroids (esteroids.eth) is a search engine for .eth websites. Esteroids indexes ENS+IPFS websites (called .eth websites), makes them searchable, and highlights the main ones. While the .eth web previously offered a variety of .eth websites, it lacked the tools to collect, explore and showcase them. We launched Esteroids in April 2021 in order to give .eth websites a dedicated search engine.","category":"Tooling and utilities"}
