{"name":"EIP-4844 Contributors Collection","description":"This nomination is for a collection of contributors to EIP4844. EIP-4844 introduces a new kind of transaction type to Ethereum which accepts 'blobs' of data to be persisted in the beacon node for a short period of time. These changes are forwards compatible with Ethereum's scaling roadmap, and blobs are small enough to keep disk use manageable. EIP-4844 is project-neutral and being developed 100% in the open by a wide mix of developers across different teams, this collection aims to reward that network of contributors.
