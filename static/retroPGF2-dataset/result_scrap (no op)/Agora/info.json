{"name":"Agora","description":"Agora builds governance public infrastructure that provides transparency, accessibility, and fine-grained control for delegates and builders. We started helping Optimism transition to on-chain voting by deploying its governance contract, and building its voting portal. Next we will refine the contract, keep improving the portal and create new governance modules that any OP project can use.","category":"Tooling and utilities"}
