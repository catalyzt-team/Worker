Establishing more robust reputation and identity systems on-chain, and bridging the gap between value-creating activities in web2 and incentive distribution in web3. We use advanced cryptographic tools like ZKP, TEE, and MPC to design modular privacy-preserving pipelines.","category":"Tooling and utilities"}
