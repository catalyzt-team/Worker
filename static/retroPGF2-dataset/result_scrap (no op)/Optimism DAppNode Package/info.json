{"name":"Optimism DAppNode Package","description":"This is a package I created that lets home users easily run an Optimism node on their DAppNode. 3 clicks (and a few days while it syncs) will get you a full node. It is now part of the official collection of packages in the DAppStore. Funds will be used to allow me to dedicate more time getting the package ready for the upcoming Optimism Bedrock update. A little funding will go a long way here!","category":"Infrastructure"}
