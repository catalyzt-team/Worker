{"name":"Otterscan","description":"Otterscan is a self-hosted, fast, local, private, block explorer. It has a very small footprint, does not require installing additional DB, middleware, etc. It works together with your Erigon node. It relies only on onchain data and offline data sources. All custom information it needs from Erigon is available as custom APIs, so other dapp can make use of them too.","category":"Infrastructure"}
