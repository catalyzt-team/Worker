It can be implemented when an NFT issuer wants his/her NFT to be redeemed for a physical object. An increasing amount of NFT issuers such as artists, fine art galeries, auction houses, brands and others want to offer a physical object to the holder of a given NFT. This standard allows EIP-721 NFTs to signal reedemability.","category":"Tooling and utilities"}
