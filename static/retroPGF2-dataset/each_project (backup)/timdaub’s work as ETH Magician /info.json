{"name":"timdaubâ€™s work as ETH Magician ","twitter":"https://twitter.com/timdaub","github":"https://github.com/attestate","website":"https://proofinprogress.com/","about":"Attestate is my bootstrapped online venture. Over a multi-year period, I've been working on foundational technology that accelerates the vision of blockchains as \"attestable\" knowledge graphs for permissions and credible neutral data storage. I've paid out-of-pocket to travel to conferences, and I've run workshops, done talks, and written standards.","question_1":"My contributions to EIP standards (most notably EIP-5192 and EIP-4973 for Soulbound tokens) have been adopted within R&D circles (e.g., Otterspace). I've pioneered new mechanism designs by implementing prototypes from Radical Markets. I'm admittedly not DIRECTLY contributing to the OP stack, but my vision and yours are closely aligned. We want more democratic tech to create DeSoc and non-finance.","question_2":"I'm an individual freelancer in Germany. Throughout 2021 and 2022, I've taken on gigs to sustain my work on public goods. Among them are companies, DAOs, and artists (some of them: https://proofinprogress.com/projects.html). But with Attestate, since November 2022, I now want to implement my vision truly without having to do it via freelance gigs. So today, I don't have any revenue. Self-funded.","team":"It's mainly me, besides some occasional external contributors that I pay via request.network."}
