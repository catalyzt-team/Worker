Although we provide a web2 to web3 bootcamp, our primary focus is curating advanced material for Solidity engineers. Examples of topics we teach include advanced testing techniques such as fuzzing and mutation testing, elliptic curve math, zero knowledge proofs, DeFi mathematics, and assembly programming.","question_1":"We provide a significant amount of free or cheap web3 developer education material. The one we were nominated for was our gas puzzles (https://github.com/RareSkills/gas-puzzles) which helps developers understand the relationship between Solidity code and gas cost. Course here: https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-solidity-understanding-and-optimizing-gas-costs","question_2":"We earn money through tuition payments for our education program.","team":"5"}
