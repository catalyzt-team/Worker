{"name":"Multicall3","twitter":"https://twitter.com/msolomon44","github":"https://github.com/mds1","website":"https://github.com/mds1/multicall","about":"Multicall3 aggregates results from multiple contract calls. This reduces the number of JSON RPC requests that need to be sent, which is especially useful if using remote nodes like Infura. This can significantly improve performance and reduce RPC usage. It also guarantees that all returned data is from the same block (i.e. an atomic read) to ensure consistency and accuracy of fetched data.","question_1":"- Multicall3 solves developers problems around performance, atomicity, & simplicity - Multicall3 is used by core tooling such as wagmi, ethers-rs, DefiLlama, and countless sites/apps - I manage deploys to ensure it's deployed to the same address on all chains, even if gas metering differsâ€”any fork of the OPStack can have Multicall3 deterministically deployed then plug into existing tooling/infra","question_2":"I work at ScopeLift, and maintain Multicall3 in my free time. I don't currently have any sources of funding or revenue for my work on Multicall3.","team":"1"}
