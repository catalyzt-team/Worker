{"name":"Apetimism Launchpad","twitter":"https://twitter.com/apetimism","github":"https://apetimism.com/launch","website":"Null","about":"Apetimism Launchpad is a no-code NFT launchpad platform that provides highly secure smart contracts and minting systems. This helps NFT project owners to streamline the launch process from weeks to just a matter of minutes.","question_1":"In most cases, the actual value of NFT is firmly bonded to its utility. Hence 'the core business' of an NFT project is what matters. With more business-driven NFT projects, more sustainable growth could be expected in the space, which would benefit everyone in the ecosystem. Apetimism Launchpad helps reduce the barrier of those project founders who do real business to start an NFT project.","question_2":"Apetimism Launchpad collects 5% of the mint fee from the paid mint project as revenue. Additionally, the platform is soon to be integrated with Zonic, the recently launched NFT marketplace built for Layer 2, which will fulfill the whole loop of the NFT ecosystem. The project is self-funded and does not have any backers or investors.","team":"We currently have only one person working on product development. Our aim is to expand the team to 4-5 people once we secure funding."}
