We want to accelerate crypto knowledge and adoption for Spanish-speaking people We engage with our community with weekly podcasts (+ 153 episodes), IRL events, Telegram, and other channels","question_1":"We believe that access to education should be a public good, so we've been producing educational content for 2 years without charging anything to the community. We support the development of the OP Stack by helping people understand what it is, how to get involved, and incentivizing the community to explore and question the space. The public good we provide is free educational content.","question_2":"The founders sustained the expenses for some time; then we got grants and sponsorships from organizations like: - The Ethereum Foundation - Ethereum Global - Bitso, the largest crypto exchange in LATAM We think education should be free, so we don't charge anything to our community. All money gather goes to produce content and to educate the community. The founders don't profit from EC.","team":"7 People: - Lalo: founder - Abraham: founder - Anatech: community lead - Diego: content analyst and researcher - Vale: design and media lead - Gabo: strategic design - Fede: Operations analyst"}
