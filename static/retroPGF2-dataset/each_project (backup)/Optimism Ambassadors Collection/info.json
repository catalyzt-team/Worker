They create memes, YouTube (longer form) content as well as tutorials and guides. To find the full list of Ambassadors and the weighting of their contributions, click on the website link at the top of the profile","question_1":"Ambassadors create unique content as well as guides and explainers on existing content, making the Optimistic vision more approachable to the masses. On top of this, they also share this content within their own communities, further widening the optimistic reach. They have done so voluntarily and as such, their impact far outweighs their profit. For a recent example of their work see the Clique meme competition.","question_2":"Occasionally there are content competitions where the Ambassadors can win prizes. Otherwise, the Ambassadors run on a voluntary basis.","team":"There are 37 Ambassadors, whose contributions are all weighted equally in this collection."}
