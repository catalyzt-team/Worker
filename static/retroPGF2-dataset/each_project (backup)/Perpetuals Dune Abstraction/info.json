{"name":"Perpetuals Dune Abstraction","twitter":"https://twitter.com/robplust","github":"https://github.com/RplusT","website":"Null","about":"The perpetuals trading abstraction on Dune standardizes the trading data amongst all the perpetuals trading platforms on Optimism and makes them all accessible in a single table, called perpetuals.trades. The primary goal is to help analysts and builders alike in gaining a deep understanding of the perpetuals market and in building tools related to the data being surfaced.","question_1":"The goal of this abstraction was to make the analysis of perpetuals convenient and accessible. As one of the main use cases of Optimism, it's important to keep track of the related metrics and help others build on top of the perpetuals data. Michael of OP Labs, other analysts, and various parties (eg traders) have been able to use this data for their analyses of the market and Optimism as a whole","question_2":"I didn't/don't get paid for building and maintaining this project but I do have a separate full-time job that pays me a monthly salary to sustain myself.","team":"While I was the one who primarily built the abstractions themselves, my discussions with drethereum, and Michael Silberling were invaluable in helping me gain a good understanding of the perpetuals trading landscape on Optimism."}
