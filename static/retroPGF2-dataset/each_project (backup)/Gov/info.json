{"name":"Gov","twitter":"https://twitter.com/w3hc8","github":"https://github.com/w3hc","website":"https://github.com/w3hc/gov","about":"Gov is a DAO framework built with Open Zeppelin’s Governor contract in combination with NFTs. It provides a retroactive funding tool that fits the needs of everyday people. We recently deployed the first pilot to OP Mainnet (the Web3 Hackers Collective) and we’re getting ready to launch more pilots in the coming weeks. We just released the beta version and the Next.js UI is currently under dev.","question_1":"As a free software, Gov is available for anyone to use. Our next step is to launch five different pilots: we want to focus quasi-exclusively on the impact evaluation process of each proposal. We’re inviting orgs, neighborhoods, stewards of the commons, collectives, and all communities to create their own DAO on Optimism. We will accompany them wether they're crypto-savvy or not.","question_2":"So far, the project never received any funding. We developed the project on our free time because we're convinced that DAOs will dramatically improve the way we take collective decisions at each and every levels of our societies.","team":"Gov is developed and maintained by the Web3 Hackers Collective (W3HC). The W3HC was recently founded by Julien Béranger, Olivier Fernandez and Bertrand Juglas. Julien Béranger is working on the topic of DAOs for almost 10 years now. Along with two fellow hackers he won the Core DAO tech 1st prize of the DAO Global Hackathon 2022 with a project called Concord, a DAO within Discord."}
