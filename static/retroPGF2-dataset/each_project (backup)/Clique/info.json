{"name":"Clique","twitter":"https://twitter.com/Clique2046","github":"https://github.com/CliqueOfficial","website":"https://clique.social/","about":"Clique builds a new type of primitives, identity oracles, that bring web2 user behavior and identity data on-chain. Establishing more robust reputation and identity systems on-chain, and bridging the gap between value-creating activities in web2 and incentive distribution in web3. We use advanced cryptographic tools like ZKP, TEE, and MPC to design modular privacy-preserving pipelines.","question_1":"We plan to use the OP AttestationStation to integrate with our identity oracles and supply off-chain and on-chain user identity information to OP addresses. These attestations can be used for Sybil resistance (e.g. for retroPGF/quadratic funding), directional incentives, and powering a more sophisticated set of dApps, like undercollateralized lending, on-chain social apps, etc.","question_2":"Clique raised a seed $3m round previously in April of 2022. Our investors include top participants from web2 and web3, including GGV, Qiming Ventures, AllianceDAO, SevenX, and others. We also have revenue from deals with major creative studios (e.g. Sony Music, Fonco Studios, AP Studios), for using our identity oracles in their NFTs. These projected revenues are expected to be realized in Q2 2023","team":"15 full-time employees. 80% of the team comprises developers with an average of 12+ years of production experience (Ex-Citibank, Bybit, etc), and cryptography researchers from various grad/Ph.D. programs (Tsinghua/Max Planck Institute, etc.)."}
