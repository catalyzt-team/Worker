{"name":"Solidity","twitter":"https://twitter.com/solidity_lang","github":"https://github.com/ethereum/solidity","website":"https://soliditylang.org/","about":"Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum.","question_1":"Solidity is used to write smart contracts for various EVM-compatible chains (including rollups like Optimism). Currently, Solidity is the most used language for smart contracts on Ethereum. According to DeFi Llama, more than 90% of all \"DeFi TLV\" is locked in contracts written in Solidity. The L1 and L2 contracts for Optimism itself are also written in Solidity.","question_2":"The Solidity programming language is an open-source, community project governed by a core team. The core team is sponsored by the Ethereum Foundation (see https://soliditylang.org/about/). Besides the funding from the Ethereum Foundation, the Solidity team received a contribution from the first Optimism RPGF round in 2021.","team":"The core team currently consists of 10 people."}
