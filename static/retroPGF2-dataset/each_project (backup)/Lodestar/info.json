{"name":"Lodestar","twitter":"https://twitter.com/lodestar_eth","github":"https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar","website":"https://lodestar.chainsafe.io/","about":"Lodestar is a Typescript ecosystem for Ethereum consensus, developed by ChainSafe Systems. Our flagship product is our production-capable beacon chain and validator client. In addition, we maintain public repositories of useful tools for public use. Some of these libraries include BLS, SSZ, Discv5, Gossipsub, and Noise.","question_1":"Active work is being done to support the OP Stack by enabling EIP-4844 to benefit L2s such as Optimism, reducing tx costs of Layer 2 fees and increasing client diversity at the Layer 1 protocol level. Additionally, Lodestar team members have been working on side projects such as Zipline which used the OP Cannon verifiable computation tools to develop a light client, enabling a trustless bridge.","question_2":"We are funded with grants from the Ethereum Foundation, Gitcoin donations and open source funding contracts for JS ecosystem open sourced libraries. We are supported by ChainSafe Systems and are a node operator on Lido Finance.","team":"We are a team of nine: One Project Manager, six full-time protocol engineers, and two devops engineers. We occasionally have community freelancers contribute work to the Lodestar open source project and our surrounding libraries."}
