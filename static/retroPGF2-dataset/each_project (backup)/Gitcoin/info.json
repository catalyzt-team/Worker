By popularizing these concepts, it's helped spark a trend across the industry of giving back and supporting Ethereum developers. Through its implementation of quadratic funding specifically, it's helped fund projects like ethers.js, Hardhat, POAP, Prysm, and even Optimism itself.","question_1":"Gitcoin and Optimism have both helped fund each others ecosystems through the heart of the last bear market, and continue to find ways to interoperate.","question_2":"Gitcoin funds itself via a DAO and has meaningful, sustainable funding. This should be strongly considered in vote allocations.","team":"45+"}
