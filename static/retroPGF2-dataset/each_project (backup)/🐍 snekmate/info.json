{"name":"🐍 snekmate","twitter":"https://twitter.com/pcaversaccio","github":"https://github.com/pcaversaccio","website":"Null","about":"🐍 snekmate are state-of-the-art, highly opinionated, hyper-optimised and secure Vyper smart contract building blocks. Or in other words, it's the OpenZeppelin version for Vyper.","question_1":"While there are plenty of Solidity libraries out there, very few people are working on high-quality and easy-to-integrate library-like Vyper code. Not only does client diversity matter but also language diversity. Any Vyper-based project built on the OP Stack will probably use Snekmate under the hood mid-term. Or in other words, Snekmate helps Vyper builders to kick start on the OP Stack.","question_2":"Some bug bounties helped me to become independent and focus on open-source work. Some people donated money to support me. No other income nor revenue streams currently.","team":"1"}
