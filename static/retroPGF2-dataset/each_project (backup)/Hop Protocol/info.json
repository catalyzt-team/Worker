{"name":"Hop Protocol","twitter":"https://twitter.com/HopProtocol","github":"https://github.com/hop-protocol","website":"https://hop.exchange/","about":"Hop Protocol is a modular stack for building cross-chain applications within the Ethereum ecosystem. To date, the Hop Token Bridge has bridged over $3.4B across Ethereum, Ethereum rollups, and adjacent chains. With our initial OP grant, Hop pioneered a fee refund program enabling users to recoup 80% of onboarding costs while gaining ownership in the Optimism network.","question_1":"Hop received one nomination for our work on Sybil detection which helped identify 17k address and redistribute 14m OP and a second for Hop's role as core infrastructure. Hop was one of the first bridge to support Optimism and has helped onboard roughly $500M and countless users. Hop also pioneered a fee refund program enabling users to recoup 80% of Optimism onboarding costs in OP.","question_2":"Hop has received minimal VC funding and will continue to raise funds sparingly to ensure broad distribution of governance power. All fund raises to date were conducted by Authereum Labs across 2 fundraises, one in 2018 and one in 2021. The total amount is just over $2m. Any fundraises moving forward will be through Hop DAO itself as Authereum Labs has transitioned to a service provider role.","team":"The core Hop team consists of 4 people but there are also individuals that contribute to the protocol and Hop DAO independently."}
