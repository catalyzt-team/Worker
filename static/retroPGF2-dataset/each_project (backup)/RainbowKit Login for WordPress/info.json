{"name":"RainbowKit Login for WordPress","twitter":"https://twitter.com/davisshaver","github":"https://github.com/davisshaver","website":"https://wp-rainbow.davisshaver.com/","about":"RainbowKit Login for WordPress is a full-featured, open source, and easy to use integration layer that empowers builders to leverage the composability of Ethereum and L2s on a WordPress site. The project prioritizes extensible, test-driven, and secure code. https://wordpress.org/plugins/rainbowkit-login-web3-integration-for-sign-in-with-ethereum/ https://github.com/davisshaver/wp-rainbow","question_1":"WordPress powers a huge chunk of the web. Unlocking integrations between WordPress and web3 represents a major opportunity for usage. RainbowKit Login supports Sign-In With Ethereum and token-gating/role mapping with the Optimism network. By providing the rails for integrating Optimism and WordPress, RainbowKit Login helps builders build and use applications on the OP Stack.","question_2":"Previously, the project received a retroactive grant from the SIWE Community Server for its work at implementing the Sign-In With Ethereum standard for WordPress. The project has also received feature requests from third-parties which were developed at below-market rates in order for the resulting code to be open sourced. RainbowKit Login is an open source project released under GPL v2 or later.","team":"RainbowKit Login is built in public by a single developer in collaboration with the communities that the plugin serves â€“ WordPress users, ENS adopters, and the whole web3 universe. Specifically, I have sought feedback from the ENS DAO and SIWE Community Server and can point to features like the plugin's ENS text records sync which are a direct result of those collaborations."}
