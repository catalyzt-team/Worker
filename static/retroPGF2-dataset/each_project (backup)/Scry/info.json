{"name":"Scry","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ScryProtocol","github":"https://github.com/ScryProtocol","website":"https://scry.finance/","about":"Scrys Open Oracle Frameworks an infrastructure for oracles for developers to access external data in a fully permissionless and decentralized way. The infrastructure allows devs to self deploy high scale oracles for any API with the contracts, nodes and front end all ready to use in <15m. This allows devs to create oracles using their own reputable signers in their communities. Uniswap for data.","question_1":"Optimism is severly underserved by other oracles with not even 50 feeds by the largest oracle providers, while Scry enables >200 feed updates with just 1 tx. These feeds also allow new capibilities such as onchain historical lookup for feeds at any timestamp, no code deployment and feed management. New feeds can be deployed in <60s. The tools are completely free, open source and can used by anyone","question_2":"Atm the project has been self funded with a current expense personally to about $300k. The project atm has had no funding but we are hoping grants can help to create ways for us to recover costs, by showing how good the tools that weve made rather than asking for funds for ideas. We are looking at a freemium model, whereby core tools are and always will be free with premium features for a fee.","team":"1. Just me. Have developed the node, contracts and fornt end, as well as docs. Have had help with contracts by a friend that's a dev but am the only person currently on the team. Highly recommend people check out the docs to get a full understanding for whats been built and the time and care that have spent. https://docs.scry.finance/"}
