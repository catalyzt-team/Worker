{"name":"Crate-Crypto","twitter":"https://github.com/kevaundray","github":"https://the.dev/","website":"Null","about":"Cryptography is hard. Crate-Crypto was originally built because I wanted to build proof of concepts of cutting edge cryptogrpahy protocols, so that companies/researchers could use it to validate their ideas quicker. This is how Noir a zk programming language was born. The main usecase right now is for implementations for projects like 4844 and verkle tries.","question_1":"I have been working on the cryptography for EIP-4844 which will be used by optimism and other L2s. Currently I am working on the golang implementation which will be used by Geth and Prysm. I wrote a TLDR here of my journey and contributions to 4844: https://hackmd.io/@6iQDuIePQjyYBqDChYw_jg/rk9dSn2Yj I plan to publish it as a blogpost, which is why it reads the way it does.","question_2":"I have two sources of funding: - Ethereum foundation: I am contracted to build the cryptography for verkle tries in Rust,Golang,Python and javascript (via bindings). - Aztec protocol: I am the author and lead of the zero knowledge programming language called Noir.","team":"1"}
