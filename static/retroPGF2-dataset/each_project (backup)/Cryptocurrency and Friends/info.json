It covers an intro to crypto, UTXO/account models, p2p network, fee markets and the scalability challenge. All background feeds into the final classes on payment channels and rollups.","question_1":"I have put together educational resources on rollups which includes how they work, mental models for evaluating them, and some systematic reviews of them. Content in the form of in-person classes, online classes, papers and blog posts. Alongside tweets promoting them. It is not OP-stack specific, but general in pursuit of all rollups.","question_2":"I work at Infura full-time.","team":"Just me."}
