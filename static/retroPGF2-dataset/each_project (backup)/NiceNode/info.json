{"name":"NiceNode","twitter":"https://twitter.com/NiceNodeApp","github":"https://github.com/NiceNode","website":"https://nicenode.xyz/","about":"NiceNode aims to provide an easy set up to run an Ethereum node in no-time on every modern computer without any technical knowledge. By running a node you become part of a global movement to decentralize a world of information. NiceNode is being designed to easily support new node types such as layer 2 and web3 nodes. It is FOSS and available on Mac, Windows, and Linux.","question_1":"NiceNode will support nodes that implement the OP Stack’s op-node. Users can run an op-node, change it settings, and monitor its status and usage. NiceNode can display output of the op-node’s RPC as defined in the Rollup node spec. Implementation will initially support Optimism’s node following smartcontract’s 'simple-optimism-node' and then support other implementations.","question_2":"NiceNode is entirely community supported through grants and donations. We have received grants from EthStaker, Gitcoin, CityDAO, and the Ethereum Foundation’s Ecosystem Support Program. There is currently no revenue.","team":"We have primarily 3 core contributors"}
