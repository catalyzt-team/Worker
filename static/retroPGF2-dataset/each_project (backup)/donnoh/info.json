I'm a MSc CS student at University of Bologna focused on scaling blockchains. In April 2022 I created the scalability.guide blog about scaling technologies, with articles such as \"Optimism Bedrock vs Arbitrum Nitro: Deposits\" and \"Exploring the blobspace\". In October 2022 I graduated with a CS bachelor's thesis on a comparison and analysis between Optimism Bedrock and StarkNet.","question_1":"My work supports the development and usage of the OP stack by analyzing the technical aspects of the protocol and making them more accessible: for example, the Bedrock vs Nitro article sparked a very interesting discussion on CT about forced inclusion delays. Furthermore, my thesis about Bedrock vs StarkNet had some academic interest and will be discussed in a DLT workshop with other universities.","question_2":"In 2022 I received a grant from StarkWare and won a prize during the ETHGlobal hackathon in Amsterdam.","team":"1"}
