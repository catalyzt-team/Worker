This involves raising awareness, informing communities about ongoing attacks against them, providing advice & developing custom tools. I perform in-depth analysis of on-chain data, often identifying & visualising clusters of related addresses.","question_1":"A core value of crypto and the OP Stack is decentralization of authority. Sybil attacks are a major challenge to this goal, as a few individuals & teams attempt to gain outsized control of a network. This is furthered by the financial incentive to sell or rent out their voting power. Finding solutions for fair distribution of power is key to a secure & inclusive ecosystem.","question_2":"I have a full time job outside of the crypto industry and therefore perform this research for free in my spare time. Additionally I participate in Sybil bounty programs. My efforts are primarily a way of contributing back to the crypto ecosystem after benefiting from price rises in the last market cycles.","team":"Individual"}
