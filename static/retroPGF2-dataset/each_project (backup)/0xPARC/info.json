{"name":"0xPARC","twitter":"https://twitter.com/0xparc","github":"https://github.com/0xparc","website":"https://0xparc.org/","about":"The 0xPARC Foundation promotes application-level innovation on Ethereum. Our primary areas of focus are: - Cryptography: ZK, MPC, and more. - Autonomous Worlds: funding projects like Lattice, Dark Forest, DFDAO, etc - Education: we organize learning residencies, hackathons, and conferences on ZK and AW. 0xPARC funds infrastructure work, research, and groups that would otherwise be underfunded.","question_1":"0xPARC funded an exploration on aggregating ECDSA signatures in order to make optimistic rollups cheaper (https://shortest.link/ecdsa). We put together educational material for ZK (http://learn.0xparc.org/) and an advanced course on ZK at MIT: https://zkiap.com/. We developed core ZK libraries like ecne, zkRepl, and more. These OSS tools will accelerate proof diversity on the OP Stack.","question_2":"0xPARC has no revenue and doesn't hold shares in any of the project we support. It is funded by the Ethereum Foundation, Gitcoin, Gather Town, Gnosis Chain, ETH Global, and some anonymous funders.","team":"0xPARC has a team of 7 full-time people."}
