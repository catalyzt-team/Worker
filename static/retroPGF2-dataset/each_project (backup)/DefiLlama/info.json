{"name":"DefiLlama","twitter":"https://twitter.com/defillama","github":"https://github.com/DefiLlama","website":"https://defillama.com/","about":"DefiLlama is an OpenSource project that tracks metrics for DeFi protocols (TVL, volume, fees, revenue, treasury...) transparently, making our data available for free to everybody. On top of that we've built: - LlamaPay, a payments tool used by multiple optimism protocols such as Velodrome - LlamaSwap, a dex meta-aggregator - our free price & metrics API and we maintain ChainList.","question_1":"- We provided the TVL metrics used by Optimism's team to allocate OP rewards - We built a calldata-optimized UniswapV3 router for Optimism, reducing costs 2-5x vs alternatives (https://github.com/0xngmi/llamazip) - Users use our site to discover defi protocols on optimism and track their metrics (TVL, volume, fees, treasury...) - Our price API is used by many Optimism protocols (eg Mean Finance)","question_2":"DefiLlama has only been funded through self-funding from founders and donations from external parties (from multiple sources: through gitcoin, directly from individuals and from protocols), to maintain neutrality no donation has been in exchange for anything else. We have not received any investment.","team":"11 full-time, 2 interns."}
