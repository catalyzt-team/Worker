{"name":"Commons Stack","twitter":"https://twitter.com/commonsstack","github":"https://github.com/commons-stack/","website":"https://commonsstack.org/","about":"Commons Stack builds 'Commons', tokenized communities supporting public goods. To achieve this, years of research have gone into developing cultural frameworks that reinforce Ostrom’s principles of governing commons, novel tools such as the Augmented Bonding Curve, Conviction Voting & Praise reward system, and a radically inclusive methodology (Collaborative Economics) for launching a Commons.","question_1":"Our open-source tools & cultural frameworks can be used on Optimism, our most aligned L2, to coordinate the production of public goods. The success of our first Commons, TEC, demonstrates that resilient liquidity is achievable for regen economies. We will continue groundbreaking research and building so that others can employ our tools and frameworks to solve complex world problems.","question_2":"Commons Stack is a nonprofit & we’ve never received any investment nor revenue for services. Up until now, our mission to build design patterns for commons-governed token economies has been sustained through generous donations on Giveth & Gitcoin. We’ve also been gifted with long-term partnership endowments from Regen Network & Giveth. Any funding from Optimism will go toward continuing this work.","team":"Our team is composed of six (6) members who are based in France, Philippines, Brazil, Ecuador, Pakistan & Spain. Four of us have been working together for over 2 years on Commons Stack & collectively we have 22 years of experience in DAOs. We partner closely with various teams like Giveth, Token Engineering Commons, Blockscience, Regen Network, RefiDAO, 1Hive, Blossom Labs and General Magic."}
