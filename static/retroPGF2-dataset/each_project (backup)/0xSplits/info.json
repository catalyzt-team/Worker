Our current offerings include splits (immutable, mutable, & liquid), waterfalls (preference stacks), and vests (multi-stream, single beneficiary) as well as the accompanying subgraphs, sdk, & UI.","question_1":"0xSplits makes it easy to reward collaboration onchain. Weâ€™ve been used by collectives (e.g. protocol guild, songcamp), DAOs (e.g. airswap, bankless, nouns), applications (e.g. sound, superrare, heds, decent, bonfire, arpeggi), and devs (e.g. quantum, props) to power payments. Our open source & free-to-use ecosystem has distributed over $25M to 4K+ unique accounts on several chains including OP.","question_2":"We have no revenue & are currently reliant on venture capital.","team":"3"}
