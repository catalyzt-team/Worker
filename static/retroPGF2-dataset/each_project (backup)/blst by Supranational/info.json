The library has undergone security audits and formal verification, and supports assembly backends for x86 and ARM platforms. Currently blst is used by all of the Eth2 / Ethereum consensus clients (Prysm, Lighthouse, Teku, Nimbus, and Lodestar). blst is a critical component for enabling scalability and performance of PoS.","question_1":"BLS signatures can help to reduce the cost of data availability for L2 transactions by aggregating multiple sigs into a single sig. The security of L2 protocols also inherent their security from the L1 protocol, and therefore the security of L2s are directly dependent on the cryptographic libraries used by the L1 teams. The OP Stack is crucial for enabling decentralization and scalability for Eth","question_2":"Supranational is self-funded by the founding team and obtains revenue for software and hardware development services.","team":"~10"}
