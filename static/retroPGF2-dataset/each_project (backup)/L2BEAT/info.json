{"name":"L2BEAT","twitter":"https://twitter.com/l2beat","github":"https://github.com/l2beat/l2beat","website":"https://l2beat.com/","about":"L2BEAT is an Ethereum Layer Two (L2) scaling analysis and research website. We compare Ethereum L2s by monitoring their usage & TVL-related metrics, verifying their documentation against the source code, and manually assessing associated risks. We have created a risk framework for L2s and bridges, along with open-source monitoring tools that check for changes in their smart contracts' parameters.","question_1":"As an independent watchdog, we provide the collective with an objective analysis of the various projects built on top of the OP stack. As an open-source developer, we provide tools that can be reused by other projects analysing OP stack projects. As an active delegate, we help the OP ecosystem to grow and we engage in building effective decentralised governance mechanisms.","question_2":"We have strategic support and grants from the Ethereum Foundation and have received funding from Gitcoin rounds and direct crypto donations. We are also involved in some commercial and semi-commercial projects focused on bringing transparency into the L2 space, such as building rollup explorers and maintaining nodes.","team":"12"}
