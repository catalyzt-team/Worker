It's the de-facto formatter for the Solidity language, used by multiple projects including Optimism itself.","question_1":"As the most popular formatter for the Solidity language, Prettier Solidity contributes to the productivity of Solidity developers, including many of those building on top of Optimism (and those building Optimism too!)","question_2":"Prettier Solidity is a free and OSS project, and its contributors work on it in their spare time. We've received some funding, mainly through Gitcoin and in Optimism's RetroPGF round, but we don't have any continuous funding nor any revenue.","team":"While we happily accept contributions from anyone, the vast majority of the project has been written by a team of 3 people."}
