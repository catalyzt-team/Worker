EIP-4844 introduces a new kind of transaction type to Ethereum which accepts 'blobs' of data to be persisted in the beacon node for a short period of time. These changes are forwards compatible with Ethereum's scaling roadmap, and blobs are small enough to keep disk use manageable. EIP-4844 is project-neutral and being developed 100% in the open by a wide mix of developers across different teams, this collection aims to reward that network of contributors.

This means that EIP4844 plays a crucial role in enabling the scalability of the OP Stack and supporting its development and usage.","question_2":"This collection is made up of individual contributors, you can find the list of contributors and the weighting of their contribution click on the website link at the top of the profile ⬆️","team":"Data blobs introduced by EIP4844 enable rollups like Optimism mainnet and other rollups built on the OP Stack to grow 100x in capacity.
