{"name":"Attestation Station Interface","twitter":"https://twitter.com/soyboy_vegan","github":"https://github.com/sbvegan","website":"https://attestationstation.xyz/","about":"This project provides a no-code solution for builders and community members to directly interact with the AttestationStation smart contract.","question_1":"This project helps the OP Stack as we are starting to build out an identity layer with the AttestationStation (and Optimist NFTs). This tool allows anyone to interact with the AttestationStation smart contract and helps builders understand the underlying building blocks. This will grow to have more functionality and hopefully inspire more things to be built on these primitives.","question_2":"I work full time as a Senior Solutions Engineer and I have received a one time grant from Perpetual Protocol in the past. This project's hosting and analytics all come out of my own pocket.","team":"I'm the only developer working on this project but it's fully open source and open to outside contributions."}
