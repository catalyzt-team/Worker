{"name":"Optimism Support NERDs Collection","twitter":"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mLNltubxm2YdNYDdiMZTyiFQm_yzTfrbqTp2zjH6rlk/edit?usp=sharing","github":"Null","website":"Null","about":"The NERD program provides human to human support on the Optimism Discord. They report spam and scams, ensure questions get answered and do so in a friendly manner. They flag issues and bugs to the team, helping the Optimism community stay safe, smart, and learn about the project. This program has been running for just over a year. They have answered hundreds of user questions while maintaining high answer satisfaction, with an average support rating of 4.75/5.

They are an invaluable connection between the team and community, often acting as the bridge for feedback and issues. They have done so on a voluntary basis and as such their impact far outweighs their profit.","question_2":"With the exception of the super-NERDs (who have been removed from this list) the NERDs run on a voluntary basis.","team":"This collection totals 35 members. There are three different NERD roles included in this collection. These groups have been weighted differently based on their contributions. The 6 Alumni NERDs were instrumental in getting the Optimism community to the point they are now. The 12 NERDs-in-training are upcoming NERDs who are finding their footing in the NERD support world. Finally, the 17 support-NERDs run the show. They do all of the user support and vibe setting described above, as well as mentoring the upcoming NERDs."}
