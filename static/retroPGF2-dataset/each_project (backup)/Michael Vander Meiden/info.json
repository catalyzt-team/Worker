{"name":"Michael Vander Meiden","twitter":"https://twitter.com/vander_meiden","github":"https://youtu.be/Tz5BMaFKK5w","website":"Null","about":"My work for the Optimism Collective falls into two categories: * 1st is my volunteer contributions to Optimism Governance, mainly planning, hosting, and recapping the bi-weekly governance calls. * 2nd is my youtube channel, 'The Blockchain Guy', making hype-free & high-quality educational content focused on the Optimism and Ethereum ecosystems.","question_1":"* Through the bi-weekly governance calls, I have created a welcoming, open, and productive space for high-quality governance discussion. These calls have been a multiplier for the quality & speed of iteration for OP governance. * My educational videos are the highest quality Optimism-focused videos on youtube. Videos topics include Optimism Governance, Bedrock, EIP-4844 & protocol deep dives.","question_2":"For the last 2 years I have been surviving using *savings* from my last web2 job along with minor supplementation from part-time poker, hackathon winnings, and YouTube. * Poker: ~$6,000 * Web3 Hackathons: ~$5,000 * Youtube: $1,477 Doing well in this round of RPGF will allow me to double down on the things I care about most: high quality educational content & helping the Optimistic Vision succeed.","team":"Just me. Everything I do is a team of one. Research, planning, filming & editing for the videos is all done 100% by myself. Same goes for planning, hosting, & summarizing the governance calls. One thing I hope to do with RPGF funds is to hire a video editor so that I can increase the quantity & quality of my educational content."}
