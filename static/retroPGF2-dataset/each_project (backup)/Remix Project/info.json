Devs can seamlessly connect to Optimism using the Metamask api and to the Optimism bridge. We reward our contributors with NFT Badges that they mint on Optimism. We want to expand the Optimism integration - including setting up a debug node. We also want to educate devs about the advantages of using Optimism.","question_2":"We receive funding from the Ethereum foundation.","team":"8 people"}
