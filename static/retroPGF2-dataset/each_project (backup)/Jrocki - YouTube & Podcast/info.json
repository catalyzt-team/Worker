{"name":"Jrocki - YouTube & Podcast","twitter":"https://twitter.com/Reformed_Normie","github":"https://www.youtube.com/@JrockiCrypto","website":"Null","about":"I have my YouTube Channel containing Optimism only content including a tutorial series for the Optimism Quests. In addition, I co-host a weekly Twitter space for the Optimism community which began as an Optipunk's NFT community call. When a project joins us the space is recorded and posted on an RSS feed known as \"The Web3 Experience\" podcast. Analytics: https://bit.ly/3KoGJGu","question_1":"All of my YouTube videos are step by step tutorials showing new users how to use the applications on the OP Stack. Example activities include the Optimism Quests, Attestations, Delegating OP. During our weekly Twitter Space we educate the community about the collective then open the space up for the community to freely share ideas and ask questions.","question_2":"I generated no revenue from any of the content I created. I had a full time web2 job that sustained me while I created this content for fun. It is important to note that I became a contractor with the Optimism Foundation in February 2023, however the work I was nominated for all happened before joining the Foundation.","team":"It is just me as an individual. It was my hope to submit this application as \"The Web3 Experience Podcast\", however my co-host is no longer in the web3 space any longer sadly. So please take this into account when valuing the public good of the The Web3 Experience Podcast episodes as I was only half of its value."}
