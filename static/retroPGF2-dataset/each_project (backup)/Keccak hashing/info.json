{"name":"Keccak hashing","twitter":"https://twitter.com/KeccakTeam","github":"https://github.com/XKCP/XKCP","website":"https://keccak.team/","about":"The Keccak project started in 2008 for the development of the Keccak hash function, winner of SHA3 competition and used in Ethereum. The project is a multi discipline effort of cryptography, software and hardware development. All the developments are open source, no patents and several incentives for 3rd party security analysis. The project is still active for providing improved implementations","question_1":"The Keccak hash function, and all its derivations, are cryptographic building blocks for the good of the society. We believe that open cryptography is a key technology for the digital society. The security of Keccak is key to the security of Ethereum and of many other digital projects. We worked a lot in analyzing its security and encouraged third-party cryptanalysis, with very positive results","question_2":"Gilles, Ronny and Michael are employees at STMicroelectornics. Gilles is professor at the University of Brussels. Joan is Professor at Radboud University. Guido is CEO of Security Pattern. We didn't receive any direct funding, the effort put in the project by team members is based on personal time, personal resources and partially allowed by the employer as R&D activity.","team":"Four of us (Guido, Joan, MichaÃ«l, Gilles) intially designed Keccak. Ronny joined forces to help us with software implementations. We received cryptanalysis review by several other researchers. We publish third party results at https://keccak.team/third_party.html"}
