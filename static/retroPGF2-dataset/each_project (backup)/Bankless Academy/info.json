Our mission is to continue Public Good operations on Ethereum, building w/ communities like Gitcoin Passport, Mintkudos and Optimism, and developing community content via our Writers Cohorts.","question_1":"Bankless Academy equips users with Gitcoin Passport, and basic knowledge + tools for confident navigation, before onboarding them to the OP ecosystem to continue their learning journey (see our L2/OP lesson). We are building more OP ecosystem content, allowing our users to collect badges and build their on-chain identity. We also host our collectable content (currently mirror.xyz articles) on OP.","question_2":"We are a non-profit project. We currently receive public goods funding from BanklessDAO, funding from lesson sponsors like 1inch and Optimism, and funding for supporting our whitelabel partners like humanDAO Academy. We previously received funding from Gitcoin grants. These sources generally fund day-to-day ops, and we hold a small treasury: 0xf80Cd14ec747b2AdF7B1A9911b38c65a885dAeeA","team":"4"}
