It reduced the development time and maintenance, and allowed to onboard partners into protocol mechanics with minimal effort. Developers are free to use it to integrate Velodrome liquidity pool data and even historical emissions, veNFT status and available rewards or just display the voting distribution.","question_2":"Core contributing dev at Velodrome Finance, other open source projects.","team":"While building sugar I benefited from feedback and reviews from https://github.com/ethzoomer and https://github.com/AkemiHomura-maow"}
