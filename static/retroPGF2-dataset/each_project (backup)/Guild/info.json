Built around the Guild Model (requirements, roles, rewards), anyone can create modular memberships based on composable on-chain and off-chain data. These can be used to gate off-chain rewards (access to Discord, Telegram, Google folders & files, Github), on-chain rewards (POAP), or custom applications (via our SDK).","question_1":"We have integrated Optimism among the first chains and onboarded over 100 communities from the OP ecosystem. We were launch partners in OP AttestationStation, enabling attestations to be used as requirements.","question_2":"We bootstrapped Guild to 20 team members, and then raised a community round, with 70+ builders, DAOs and investors participating","team":"25"}
