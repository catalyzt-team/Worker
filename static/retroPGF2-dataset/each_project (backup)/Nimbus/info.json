{"name":"Nimbus","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ethnimbus","github":"https://github.com/status-im/","website":"https://nimbus.team/","about":"Nimbus is a client implementation for both Ethereum’s consensus layer and execution layer that strives to be as lightweight as possible in terms of resources used. This allows it to perform well on embedded systems, embedded devices – including Raspberry Pis and mobile devices.","question_1":"Nimbus is trying to accelerate the development of L2 protocols such as OP through the ongoing work on EIP-4844. In the future, we hope to bring more client diversity in the Optimism network, both in terms of node software for end users and in highly efficient components for the construction and verification of fault proofs.","question_2":"We receive development grants for the Ethereum Foundation, donations for individuals and revenue from Ethereum staking and oracle node provision services. These sources of funding are currently not enough to cover our development costs and the sustainability of the project depends on additional funding from Status.im.","team":"8"}
