{"name":"Chainlist","twitter":"https://github.com/DefiLlama/chainlist","github":"https://chainlist.org/","website":"Null","about":"Chainlist tracks all public RPCs available for each EVM network, along with their latency, blockheight and the privacy policy of the provider, which we summarize into easy-to-compare snippets. This allows users to switch networks/RPCs safely and to maintain privacy without having to spend hours sifting through legal docs.","question_1":"- Decentralizes RPC infra for Optimism: without it most people would just use the RPC provided by optimism's team to avoid having to search and vet other rpcs - Improves onboarding UX for Optimism users by allowing them to add Optimism to their wallet safely and quickly - Makes evaluation of RPCs' privacy policies and performance much simpler and faster for users (otherwise this could take days)","question_2":"Funded through donations and self-funding.","team":"It doesn't have a fixed team, most work on it is handled by 3 people, but this is highly flexible."}
