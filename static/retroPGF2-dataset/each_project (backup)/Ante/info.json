Ante tests can be written to test any on-chain condition with payouts handled without any third parties. With enough coverage and tests on a given project, a decentralized and visual trust can then be gathered on that respective project.","question_1":"While we are blockchain agnostic, we hope to be used on Optimism to allow users easier insight into projects and what confidence the broader community has in the project. This will garner trust in projects and allow users to know what projects are more trustworthy.","question_2":"We currently have minimal revenue, mainly from interest, and have been funding R&D through a pre-seed and seed round closed last year with some VC firms and angel investors.","team":"<10 Team Members"}
