{"name":"Smock","twitter":"https://twitter.com/DeFi_Wonderland","github":"https://github.com/defi-wonderland/smock","website":"https://defi.sucks/","about":"Smock is the Solidity mocking library. It is installed as a Hardhat plugin which can be used to create mock Solidity contracts entirely in JavaScript (or TypeScript!). With Smock, writing tests for smart contracts becomes incredibly easy, improving the ecosystem's security. First built by Optimism in March 2021 and later, in July 2021, Wonderland took the mission to rewrite it in a scalable way","question_1":"With our improvements, Smock has become the de facto Solidity mocking library. Its use has been extended among Optimism and solidity developers in all EVM chains, and we’re proud of reaching 17 releases, dependency in 795 repositories & 279 stars in GitHub. Smock usage can be found all over the main Optimism Repository and in many other protocols currently deployed in Optimism.","question_2":"Since July 2021, DeFi Wonderland has been covering all of the costs related to Smock development. This includes both dedicating time of DeFi Wonderland’s developers, and funding bounties in DeWork in order to further incentivize community development.","team":"Smock has been a joint effort by DeFi Wonderland, Optimism, and external contributors.
