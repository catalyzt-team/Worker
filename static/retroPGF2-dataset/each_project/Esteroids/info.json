{"name":"Esteroids","twitter":"https://twitter.com/e_steroids","github":"https://github.com/esteroids/","website":"https://esteroids.eth.limo/","about":"Esteroids (esteroids.eth) is a search engine for .eth websites. Esteroids indexes ENS+IPFS websites (called .eth websites), makes them searchable, and highlights the main ones. While the .eth web previously offered a variety of .eth websites, it lacked the tools to collect, explore and showcase them. We launched Esteroids in April 2021 in order to give .eth websites a dedicated search engine.","question_1":"Esteroids is a useful tool to discover dApps with a .eth website interface built on top of Optimism. Every Optimism dApp using a decentralized website as an interface is indexed by Esteroids. So far Esteroids was the only place to track and collect them all. Additionally, Esteroids established and led the .eth websites subgroup in ENS DAO in Q1-Q4 2022.","question_2":"Esteroids sustain itself via contributions and grants. Our funding so far came from: - Open Grant Application for IPFS https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/357 - Gitcoin contributions.","team":"The core team is two people, the founders, Neiman and Tomer Leicht, both work on it full-time. We employed another person in 2022 for community building but had to let her go at the end of the year due to budget restrictions.","OP Allocation":"4,759.80"}
