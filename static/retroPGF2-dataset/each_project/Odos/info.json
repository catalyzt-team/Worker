{"name":"Odos","twitter":"Null","github":"Null","website":"Null","about":"Odos Smart Order Routing (SOR) is a patented Automated Market Maker (AMM) path finding algorithm, which aggregates decentralized exchanges (DEX) and finds optimal routes for cryptocurrency token swaps. Odos enables retail and institutional traders to benefit from savings over any single DEX and even other aggregators when converting one or several cryptocurrency tokens into other asset(s).","question_1":"We are tightly integrated with the entire Optimism DeFi ecosystem, driving volume/usage to the protocols that provide the most value to their users. To our users, we provide the best rates for the swaps they execute. Odos is also participating in Optimism Governance via the protocol delegation program.","question_2":"Our primary source of funding is a seed round we raised a year ago. We currently also make a small amount of revenue off of swap positive slippage, but this is a very small amount in order to not compromise the rates we provide to users.","team":"We currently have 3 core developers and 2 core operations people, with some part time contractors also working on the project. However, we would like to significantly expand the team this year to build more Odos offerings.","OP Allocation":"2,619.19"}
