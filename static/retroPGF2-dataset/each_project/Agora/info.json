{"name":"Agora","twitter":"https://twitter.com/nounsagora","github":"https://github.com/voteagora/agora","website":"https://vote.optimism.io/","about":"Agora builds governance public infrastructure that provides transparency, accessibility, and fine-grained control for delegates and builders. We started helping Optimism transition to on-chain voting by deploying its governance contract, and building its voting portal. Next we will refine the contract, keep improving the portal and create new governance modules that any OP project can use.","question_1":"Our app & contract are open source and MIT-licensed for any builder to leverage. Additionally, we'll ship a 1 click deploy governance package for DAOs on OP. By making best-in-class governance contracts & applications accessible to all, we will radically increase accountability, transparency and decentralization for all projects in the Collective without trading off accessibility and ease of use.","question_2":"Today, our primary source of funding comes from project revenue from DAOs and Foundations. We hope to stay sustainable and remain independent by delivering value and being rewarded by ecosystems. We have not raised an institutional round, but we have a bit of friends & family funding to cover expenses and keep our team afloat during market up and downs.","team":"Team consists of 5 people right now. We also have a community of supporters and contractors who has helped contribute to various projects from time to time.","OP Allocation":"101,992.05"}
