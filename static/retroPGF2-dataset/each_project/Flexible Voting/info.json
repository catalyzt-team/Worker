{"name":"Flexible Voting","twitter":"https://github.com/ScopeLift","github":"https://flexible.vote/","website":"Null","about":"Flexible Voting is an extension to the widely used OpenZeppelin DAO Governor that enables powerful new voting patterns for voting through client contracts. This new building block allows arbitrary delegate contracts to be developed which can unlock all kinds of new use cases.","question_1":"When adopted and deployed, Flexible Voting will allow holders of mainnet DAO Governance tokens to bridge those tokens to Optimism but still participate (trustlessly) in Governance votes on L1. They will submit their vote on Optimsim, or even shield, or earn yield on their bridged token while still having votes reflected on L1. This will encourage Governance token liquidity bridged to Optimism.","question_2":"Flexible Voting was initially developed with a grant from the Uniswap Grants Program. It has since received funding from Aave, GitcoinDAO, and the EF for continued development.","team":"Flexible Voting is built by ScopeLift, a six person team of EVM experts that has contributed to many projects in the Ethereum ecosystem.","OP Allocation":"19,056.60"}
