{"name":"TrueBlocks","twitter":"https://twitter.com/trueblocks","github":"https://github.com/TrueBlocks/trueblocks-core","website":"https://trueblocks.io/","about":"TrueBlocks creates a shared, naturally sharded index of addresses for any EVM-based chain (including Optimism). This allows ultra-fast access to the underlying chain data and runs 100% locally. The near-zero cost of operation promotes a true public good. A video explainer is here: https://loom.com/share/fd75d19f1dc946498c4ea0344517c2c6. For detailed info, see here: https://urlis.net/i98eydu0.","question_1":"TrueBlocks already works quite well on Eth mainnet. We've experimented (successfully) with indexing the Optimism chain, but we lack the resources to continue. We seek to bring the Unchained Index to the Optimism chain. The index is naturally sharded and shared by each user providing a near-zero cost of distribution ensuring its status as a public good. See the explainers.","question_2":"TrueBlocks is self-funded through grant money and some personal funds. Grant sources have been (and continue to be) Optimism RetroPGF Round 1, IPFS Foundation, Ethereum Foundation (twice), Moloch DAO, Consensys, and many individual and matching donations through GitCoin grants.","team":"Thomas Rush, CEO and lead architect. In the web 3.0 space since late 2015. An active member of many communities including Moloch DAO, GitCoin, Eth Magicians, and sometimes a core dev. Recipient of two Ethereum Foundation grants. Dawid Szlachta, lead developer. With TrueBlocks since 2019, Dawid holds a bachelorâ€™s degree in Philology from the University of Warsaw and long industry experience.","OP Allocation":"71,866.56"}
