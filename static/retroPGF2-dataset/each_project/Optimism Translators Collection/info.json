  "about": "The Optimism Translators are a group spanning 25 languages. They translate the Optimism User Help documentation, as well as translating blog posts and tweets as they are published. To find the full list of Translators and the weighting of their contributions click on the website link at the top of the profile ⬆️",
  "question_1": "Translators provide one of the most important things you can contribute - accessibility. They make it easier for a wide (and more decentralised) community to fall in love with the Optimistic vision. They have done so voluntarily, and as such, their impact far outweighs their profit. To see examples of their contributions, check the official discord > resource-for-everyone, where you can see an incomplete list of existing translations.",
  "question_2": "The translators contribute on a voluntary basis",
  "team": "This collection totals 87 contributors. There are 14 lead translators, who act as proofreaders and translators for our user docs on CrowdIn (our translating software of choice), as well as running the native channels in our discord. There are 31 general CrowdIn translators, who translate our docs into various languages. Last, but certainly not least are the 42 article translators, who, unprompted, translated dozens of blog posts, tweet threads and articles! The contributions of the translators are weighted based on the individual impact (such as the number of words translated in CrowdIn, number of articles translated, etc. See sheet for more info).",
