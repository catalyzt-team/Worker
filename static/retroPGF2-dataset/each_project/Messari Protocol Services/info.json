{"name":"Messari Protocol Services","twitter":"https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto","github":"https://github.com/messari","website":"https://messari.io/","about":"Our work falls under 3 buckets: Subgraph development - We've built standardized subgraphs for most of the top Optimism projects. Data dashboards - Charting TVL, trading volume, revenue, liquidity added/removed from both the macro level and on an individual pool basis. Governance reporting - Breaking down governance structures and looking at voter/delegate analysis","question_1":"The open-source subgraph infrastructure improves the tooling available to facilitate a more robust developer community enabling them to create powerful tools. The data dashboards provide the community with more granular data sets to make more informed decisions. The governance reports give a clearer idea of the power dynamics of the DAO","question_2":"Messari has raised $60m in venture funding, however, our Protocol Services arm is a separate unit from the revenue generating Messari Enterprise. The entirety of our work is publicly available and therefore not monetized through any paywall, so it is solely funded through project grants to cover the research, data science, engineering, and business efforts to make this work possible.","team":"150","OP Allocation":"19,085.86"}
