Snapshot provides a way for DAO members to cast votes on proposals and make decisions collectively, without the need for a centralized authority. By using Snapshot, DAOs can increase transparency and accountability in their decision-making processes.","question_1":"Snapshot has been used both by the Optimism Collective and 64 projects on Optimism to facilitate governance. All of these services have been provided for free, both for governance participants and the projects themselves. Some stats: - 1.15M votes have been cast in the Optimism collectiveâ€™s governance - 93 proposals - 88650 participants","question_2":"Snapshot spun out of Balancer in August 2020. After sustaining ourselves based on donations and Gitcoin grants, we raised a seed round of $4M in August 2021. Since then, we haven't received any other funding and have removed ourselves from Gitcoin grants. We have no revenue, everything on Snapshot is free and we don't monetize any of our user's data.","team":"The team is currently 12 people, working on different initiatives. We're also lucky to have dedicated community members helping to build Snapshot bit by bit.","OP Allocation":"145,698.50"}
