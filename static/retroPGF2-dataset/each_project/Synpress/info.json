It's a pioneer tool in web3 e2e testing with potential to evolve into a decentralized network of test runners (and CI provider) in future.

Jakub have worked 1:1 with devs across Optimism to support them in using Synpress, and he would like to continue developing the project by expanding the scope and features of the tool.","question_2":"Synpress is fully open-source project without funding and revenue.","team":"1; Jakub@Synthetix.","OP Allocation":"91,886.73"}
