{"name":"Rust-cannon-template","twitter":"https://twitter.com/WillemOlding1","github":"https://github.com/willemolding","website":"https://github.com/willemolding/rust-cannon-template","about":"The Rust Cannon template is a starting point for developers who want to build and experiment with the provable execution layer of the OP stack. It makes it simple to compile Rust code to MIPs with helpers to read inputs, write outputs and access the pre-image oracle. The results of the execution of this code can be fraud-proven on-chain using the OP stack challenge game Solidity contracts.","question_1":"Previously only Golang was supported by Optimism for targeting for the Cannon provable execution layer. Adding support for Rust means a lot of existing code and expertise can be leveraged in building for the OP stack. This will hopefully lead to more experimentation and innovation. This has the potential to challenge projects such as TrueBit and Cartesi for on-chain provable execution.","question_2":"Work on this project was done in spare time and without funding. It has no sources of revenue.","team":"2","OP Allocation":"5,995.93"}
