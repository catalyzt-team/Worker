{"name":"Blobscan","twitter":"https://twitter.com/blossom_labs","github":"https://github.com/Blobscan","website":"https://blobscan.com/","about":"Blobscan is the first EIP4844 Blob Transaction explorer, a web-based application that offers a seamless experience for navigating and indexing blob data. The explorer will have data gas metrics to help users understand the costs associated with this new transaction type, blob data decoding for each rollup, and an API to manipulate blobs.","question_1":"The explorer was built during ETHBogota hackathon and is developed as an open source project. It has been used by client teams building the EIP4844 specification. EIP4844 will enable cheaper, more scalable L2s, which will benefit the Optimism ecosystem, and Blobscan was contribution to that effort.","question_2":"We sustain ourselves through grants. Right now our only source of funding is a grant from the Ethereum Fundation Ecosystem Support Program. We have plans to monetize by offering premium features and services for advanced users and enterprises. Our goal is to balance the need for sustainability with our commitment to providing a public good for the Ethereum community.","team":"Our team consists of 4 full-time developers with years of experience developing on Ethereum and a solid background in blockchain infrastructure. We are working with a contractor for the UI/UX designs. And we have plans to add one more person full-time to help us with the web development.","OP Allocation":"40,012.19"}
