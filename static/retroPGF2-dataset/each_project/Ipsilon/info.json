{"name":"Ipsilon","twitter":"https://twitter.com/teamipsilon","github":"https://github.com/ipsilon","website":"https://ipsilon.xyz/","about":"Ipsilon is a research team focusing on the execution environment of Ethereum (aka the EVM or any future versions of it). We provide analysis and implementation of own and third party proposals (i.e. new EIPs proposing changes to the EVM), provide tooling (evmc, evmone, fizzy), and support existing teams (e.g. Solidity, go-ethereum, Silkworm, Erigon) with implementation and analysis.","question_1":"A number of our EIPs have been adopted by Ethereum Mainnet. We have meaningfully contributed to go-ethereum, Solidity, the ACD process, and Ethereum testing. Currently our focus is EOF (EVM Object Format) and EVMMAX, revamping how the EVM works. Contributing to the selfdestruct-removal and EIP-4844 precompile. Fun fact: Optimismâ€™s Solidity modifications were an inspiration for the RJUMP opcode.","question_2":"We are supported by the Ethereum Foundation for covering compensation (salaries) of team members. Some members are part of the Protocol Guild. No other funding or incentive system is in place.","team":"Currently 5 core contributors (see the list on https://ipsilon.xyz) and a handful of collaborators. We started in 2016 as a team of 2. Since 2018 mostly had 6 team members, with a peak of 12 people during 2019-2022.","OP Allocation":"23,531.25"}
