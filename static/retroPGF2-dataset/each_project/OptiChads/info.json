Half of our mint was donated to retropgf.eth We famously gave out 50,000 OP through fitness challenges that increased the social presence of Optimism while strengthening the health of its users. We continue to build new art and tools (like an upcoming exchange) that will grow the usage of the OP Stack.","question_2":"- OptiChads was entirely self funded by myself the artist (Dicaso). - 5E gained from our mint after our 5E donation - 600 Chads in our Treasury (Worth 24E currently) - Royalties from secondary sales is my only source of income. OptiChads is my full time job. Our holdings are for giveaways and future partnerships and aren't so liquid currently.","team":"6 Total: Artist - @Dicaso5 Dev - @DistractionBoy_ Discord Team (4)","OP Allocation":"8,606.59"}
