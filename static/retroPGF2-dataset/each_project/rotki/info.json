The mission of rotki is to bring transparency for crypto through the use of open source. Unlike virtually every other competing service which consists of closed source SaaS onto which you are forced to hand over all your financial data, with rotki your data is stored encrypted locally.","question_1":"- An opensource tool for tracking portfolio of Optimism users across all their optimism addresses and protocols - An opensource tool for doing accounting and PnL across all optimism addresses - An ever growing set of modular opensource decoders to turn optimism transactions into human readable list of events that can be used by other software projects","question_2":"We sustain the project mainly through three distinct sources of funding. I will list them in descending order of worth/amount. 1. Grants (like this one) from projects/protocols/chains wanting to fund their integrations into rotki. 2. Donations from users/community (gitcoin) 3. Premium subscription from users.","team":"6 devs 1 non-dev","OP Allocation":"145,272.64"}
