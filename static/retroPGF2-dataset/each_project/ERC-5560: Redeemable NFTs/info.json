{"name":"ERC-5560: Redeemable NFTs","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ATO_nft","github":"https://github.com/ATO-nft","website":"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5560","about":"The EIP-5560 (Redeemable NFTs) adds a redeem function to EIP-721. It can be implemented when an NFT issuer wants his/her NFT to be redeemed for a physical object. An increasing amount of NFT issuers such as artists, fine art galeries, auction houses, brands and others want to offer a physical object to the holder of a given NFT. This standard allows EIP-721 NFTs to signal reedemability.","question_1":"The EIP-5560 is a tool at the disposal of the Optimism NFT community. We're planning to deploy a reference implementation to OP Mainnet: the Minifolio NFT contract (https://github.com/ATO-nft/minifolio/blob/main/contracts/Minifolio.sol) will hold 1 ETH for hackers to grab in case of a successful attack. We also provide 24/7 support to any Optimism project integrating with EIP-5560.","question_2":"So far, the project never received any funding. It is developed by the dev team of Āto (https://ato.network).","team":"Olivier Fernandez (@fernandezOli), Frédéric Le Coidic (@FredLC29), Julien Béranger (@julienbrg). We have a rich experience in developing NFT projects so we'll be happy to share our expertise on tech, legal, and security aspects with NFT projects and teams developing on Optimism.","OP Allocation":"1,072.54"}
