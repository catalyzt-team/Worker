{"name":"Teku","twitter":"https://twitter.com/Teku_ConsenSys","github":"https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku","website":"Null","about":"Teku is an Ethereum consensus client, fully open source and Apache 2 licensed. Teku has been in production on the beacon chain since genesis and contributes significantly to client-diversity on the consensus layer, which is vital for the security and safety of layer 2 solutions built on Ethereum.","question_1":"The Teku team has been working hard to implement and improve EIP-4844, the key enabler for highly scalable roll-ups such as Optimism. In addition, the initial work on the C-KZG library that provides the cryptographic interface for EIP-4844 was done by a Teku team member. This will likely be used by several of the consensus and execution clients, as well as roll-up operators.","question_2":"All work on Teku to date has been fully funded by ConsenSys. Teku has never received external grant funding. Teku participates in the Ethereum Foundation's client incentive program. Only post-Merge transaction fee revenue from that is currently available to us, amounting to 8.1055 ETH to date.","team":"Eight, comprising seven full time developers plus a product manager.","OP Allocation":"78,199.65"}
