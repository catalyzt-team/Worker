{"name":"Across Protocol","twitter":"https://twitter.com/AcrossProtocol","github":"https://github.com/across-protocol","website":"https://across.to/","about":"Across is a cross-chain bridge for L2s and rollups secured by UMA's optimistic oracle. It is optimized for capital efficiency with a single liquidity pool, a competitive relayer landscape, and a no-slippage fee model.","question_1":"Optimism's canonical bridge has a 7 day withdrawal period, which can be a real deterrent to potential new users. Across is breaking down this barrier to entry by giving users access to a bridge that is nearly instantaneous and nearly free to use. We play a role in a critical landscape and offer top tier security to Optimism users. Across has facilitated over $140 million in transfers to Optimism.","question_2":"Currently Across is sustained by the Risk Labs foundation, which covers all of the operational costs of the protocol. In order to maximize the experience for bridge users AND LPs, the protocol does not currently generate revenue for the treasury. The bridge landscape is extremely competitive, and it's important to us to stay focused on users.","team":"Risk Labs has a total of 33 team members who work on UMA and Across. Because Across is built on top of UMA, there is a fair amount of overlap and collaboration between teams.","OP Allocation":"15,038.62"}
