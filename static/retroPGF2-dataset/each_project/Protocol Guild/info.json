These will reduce rollup user fees while broadening access to Ethereum‚Äôs trust assurances. üåê The median Protocol Guild member has been active for ~3 years in protocol maintenance and improvements, including the work mentioned above.","question_2":"Just as Ethereum doesn't allocate a % of block rewards to fund Public Goods, the Protocol Guild doesn't have a native source of funding. To help bootstrap PG and its 1 year Pilot, a number Ethereum-based projects provided ~$10mm in funding last year: vesting directly to individuals.
