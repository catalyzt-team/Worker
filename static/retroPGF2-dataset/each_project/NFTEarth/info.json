{"name":"NFTEarth","twitter":"https://twitter.com/NFTEarth_L2","github":"https://github.com/NFTEarth","website":"https://nftearth.exchange/","about":"NFTEarth is an NFT marketplace for buying and selling NFTs on L2. In addition to being a marketplace, the protocol has a native token, $NFTE, and is building out the NFTEarth \"NFT Hub\" - which aims to server as a one-stop-shop for NFT creators, collectors, and DAOs looking to generate NFT art, deploy and manage contracts, and create allowlists as well as Mint embeds for their NFTs.","question_1":"NFTs hold tremendous potential for on-boarding new users to web3 - especially on Layer2 networks like Optimism. NFTEarth chose to deploy on Optimism because there are already strong NFT communities that exist on the L2 network, but lack of a current sustainable marketplace that is dedicated to these communities like NFTEarth is.","question_2":"NFTEarth currently is generating revenue through trading fees on the marketplace contract - which is currently set at 2.5%. In addition to this, the project has created multiple NFT collections itself which have raised around $5,000 $USD at this point in time. The only other source of funding at this time has been the incubation round from the Layer2DAO in early January, 2023 of 27,500 $OP tokens.","team":"11","OP Allocation":"594.26"}
