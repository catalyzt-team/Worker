  "about": "The project consists of 3 parts: Optimism-Resolver: a trustless resolver for ENS utilizing CCIP. The verification is done using Merkle-proofs for all used slots. dm3 – web3 messaging protocol: a lean messaging protocol with focus on e2ee, decentralization, scalability, and interoperability. dm3 embedded components: messaging components to embed in dApps to add interoperable messaging to dApps.",
  "question_1": "Optimism-Resolver: ENS names and records can be stored on OP and trustless resolved and verified in layer 1. The approach can be easily adapted to any other data from OP. dm3 protocol: Uses ENS as a registry for communication info (public keys, delivery info). Utilizes ENS names on OP as more practical storage than layer 1. dm3 embedded components: add messaging to any dApp in the OP ecosystem.",
  "question_2": "All these tools are open source and a Public Good, they were conceived to remain free and accessible, so no income comes from them. 400k funding came from Corpus.io: a venture studio that develops solutions for the Ethereum ecosystem. Winners of the Small Grants program from ENS.",
  "team": "Steffen Kux (CEO), Heiko Burkhardt (CTO), Eduardo Vega-Patiño (Community Lead), Mayra Castillo (Community manager) and Alex Plutta (Software Engineer). For the optimal conditions, two more developers are needed.",
