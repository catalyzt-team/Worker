This educational tool led to my broader effort to spread information about the Layer 2/Scaling ecosystem's development via my Twitter account (@bitsplaining), w/ a weekly educational thread, for which I'd like to accept this nomination.","question_1":"I lead Layer 2 tooling at Truffle, & work to develop open source tooling that makes Layer 2 development easier and more straightforward, in order to help the ecosystem continue to grow. From my personal Twitter handle (@bitsplaining), I publish a weekly thread called \"Layer 2 Landscape\", where I detail new educational materials & protocol developments in the Layer 2 space.","question_2":"I work full time as an engineer at ConsenSys, on the Truffle team. I spend a great deal of time outside working hours learning about developments in the Layer 2 ecosystem and conveying that information to the community via my Layer 2 Landscape Twitter thread, which I have published nearly every weekend for over a year.","team":"The Truffle team is 10 people. I am currently the only engineer fully focused on the Layer 2 space, and I write the Layer 2 threads by myself.","OP Allocation":"25,407.48"}
