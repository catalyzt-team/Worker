We target users and developers in Arab countries such as UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.","question_1":"We provide knowledge for free, with this knowledge developers and users can learn about Optimism and start building! Through the website and the academy, we can reach new users and developers, as the Arab world is full of talents, but suffers from a lack of resources.","question_2":"There are no sources of funding or revenue. We spent from our own pocket to create and develop the website/the academy and make the content. We have support from cryptoblarabi.com (one of the largest and oldest Arabic crypto news websites) in terms of marketing.","team":"3","OP Allocation":"5,322.68"}
