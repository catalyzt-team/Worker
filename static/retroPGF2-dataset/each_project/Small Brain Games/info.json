These games: 1. Are open source and fully on-chain 2. Strive to be accessible to anybodyâ€“not just crypto-native users 3. Are about persistence and composability (less so than ownership) We've launched Words3, a fully on-chain word game on Optimism. We have 2 more games queued up for Q1 2023.","question_1":"Words3, a game launched on Optimism, was played by around 100 unique wallets. These people had to learn about Optimism, bridge to the chain, and play a game on it! Also, many of these people had never heard of Optimism (or some, even rollups) before. This is a great type of audience to bring to the chain.","question_2":"Grant funding from 0xPARC. No revenue was taken from Words3, which is the game we've launched so far.","team":"1 FT member","OP Allocation":"28,260.70"}
