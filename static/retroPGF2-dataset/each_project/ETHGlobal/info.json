{"name":"ETHGlobal","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ETHGlobal","github":"https://github.com/ethglobal","website":"https://ethglobal.com/","about":"ETHGlobal is the largest developer focused community in Ethereum. Most known for their hackathons, ETHGlobal has run 50+ hackathons around the world and online. To support builders at any point in their journey, ETHGlobal builds products for its developer community's success including: Hackathon (online/in-person), Guides (self-directed education), Summits (online/in-person), Jobs, and more.","question_1":"Over the last few years, we've been supporting Optimism, the Collective, and the OP Stack by continuously putting the technology in front of builders. We've seen 250+ projects built and deployed to Optimism Mainnet at our 2022 events and we organized and managed the Optimism Summit (https://www.youtube.com/live/GCmfFdNdEfU), one of the first major pieces of education about the OP Stack.","question_2":"In order to remove any barrier to entry to builders, ETHGlobal has never charged a fee to attend our hackathons, as a result, we are fully funded by our generous partners, like Optimism, who help support the work that we do directly.","team":"15","OP Allocation":"230,005.52"}
