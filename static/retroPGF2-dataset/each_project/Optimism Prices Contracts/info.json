{"name":"Optimism Prices Contracts","twitter":"https://github.com/ethzoomer/optimism-prices","github":"https://github.com/ethzoomer/optimism-prices","website":"Null","about":"A set of Optimism-unique smart contracts that can price any ERC20 asset that exists in a liquidity pool on Optimism, completely replacing the need for centralized price APIs. Supports pricing that requires complex routes with many hops, supports non-standard ERC20 implementations and non-standard AMM curves, and allows for fetching the prices of hundreds of tokens in a single RPC call.","question_1":"Optimism Prices Contracts are not only decentralized/trustless, but a superior solution than centralized APIs. Some of the largest Optimism dapps solely use Optimism Prices for pricing data; they no longer need to shell out cash for centralized pricing APIs, or pray that Coingecko's API is able to price a brand new token that appeared on the chain, instead they can merely execute a single RPC call","question_2":"The Optimism Prices Contracts team does not have any funding or revenue, and by design the product will always be an open source public good. To sustain ourselves personally, we both work as full stack developers within the Optimism ecosystem.","team":"Two team members: ZoomerAnon - smart contract developer, Meowmeow - smart contract developer. The development of our contracts is 100% open source, so anybody can always contribute with a pull request on Github. We frequently take feedback from teams that use the contracts in prod to decide what new features to focus on - for example, the LP reserves caching system is a result of this feedback.","OP Allocation":"5,973.38"}
