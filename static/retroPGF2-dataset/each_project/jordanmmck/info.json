With every video I try to completely understand the topic I am studying, then condense that understanding down to diagrams and images that convey the concept in a simple way. I strive to produce videos with high production value, detailed and accurate diagrams, and a compelling delivery.","question_1":"My goal is to help people deeply understand Ethereum and its ecosystem. My videos are not made for mass-appeal, but for builders and creators â€” the people that I hope will help us build a new world with this technology. I've done videos on L2 scaling with a focus on ZK roll-ups, but I would love to do a video specifically on optimistic roll-ups and the Optimism ecosystem.","question_2":"During the first half of last year I was doing videos full-time and living off my savings. Now I've had to return to software development contract work to sustain myself, so the videos have been put on hold. I'm now trying to work on the videos on evenings and weekends, while still working my day job. Last year I received a small grant from Starkware to support my videos.","team":"Just me.","OP Allocation":"5,566.61"}
