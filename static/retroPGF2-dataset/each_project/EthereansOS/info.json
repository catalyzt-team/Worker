Everything in the nation is powered by generalized smart contract factories built on EthereansOS.","question_1":"We have deployed Ethereans OS both on main-net and Optimism. Some of the tools include: Colonies: A tool for managing earnings of protocols between L1 and L2. Items: Super-standard of ERC-721 and ERC-20 with dynamic metadata. Covenants: Factory customizable DeFi routines and farming set ups. Generalized Factories: A factory aggregator and set of generalized contracts for developers.","question_2":"EthereansOS is the first on-chain Entity that rules the economy of the EthereansOS Nation. Earnings come from the usage of our tools, the inflation of our token OS, and the management of an Investment fund. Holders run the economy of EthereansOS independently from Ethereans Labs. There is no VC funding for EthereansOS. https://dune.com/ethereans_labs/ethereans-os-economics","team":"The Ethereans Labs team currently counts 15 core members divided into three primary teams: - Magicians (coders and Data Analysts) - Artists (illustrators and video animators) - Masters (Communication, law, and B2B) We also expand our team with the constant collaboration of 5 external teams for UI, development, and R&D.","OP Allocation":"5,990.16"}
