{"name":"Frame","twitter":"https://twitter.com/0xFrame","github":"https://github.com/floating/frame","website":"https://frame.sh/","about":"Frame is a web3 platform that creates a secure, system-wide interface to your chains and accounts, giving any browser, command-line, or native application the ability to access web3. Our routing architecture, Omnichain, simplifies the user experience by eliminating the concept of \"being on a chain\" and allowing dapps to route requests to any of the user's available chains in parallel.","question_1":"Omnichain routing was built to enable a seamless experience for users operating in the multichain world of EVM L2s. We are dedicated to developing the wallet-level specs and interfaces needed to push this space forward and make it easy for developers to build multichain functionality that minimizes complexity and streamlines the user experience across the entire OP stack and ecosystem.","question_2":"Frame's development is funded by a seed round raised at the end 2021. We raised 3.8m in that round. Frame does not currently have any revenue.","team":"Frame Labs is currently a team of four engineers. We're eager to continue growing the team over the next year.","OP Allocation":"47,826.28"}
