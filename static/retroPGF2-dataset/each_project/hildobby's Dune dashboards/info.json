{"name":"hildobby's Dune dashboards","twitter":"Null","github":"Null","website":"Null","about":"This project includes various Dune dashboards I have created as a contribution to the Optimism ecosystem. I have also recently created an open source wash trades filtering method that can be used on Optimism NFT trade data. I intend to share more methods like this one going forward which will be usable on Optimism data within Dune and open sourced so it can easily be ported out of Dune.","question_1":"Many entities provide data behind a paywall but I think in a truly decentralised world, everyone should have equal access to easily digestible data for free, so that is where I come in. I try to make sense of public data and share that work!","question_2":"I sustain myself through freelancing gigs and retroactive grants for my work. I have gotten grants from: - Gitcoin grant: https://gitcoin.co/grants/6191/hildobbys-dune-dashboards - ETH staker: https://qf.ethstaker.cc/#/project/0x6deb00f975dd2893d3383daccfdb5b7b89a06fd3f8decf81bcfd16c488104fb9 I have also received retroactive grants from the ENS and LIDO teams in the past for my Dune dashboards.","team":"1","OP Allocation":"31,170.72"}
