It was created shortly after the OP token was launched: there was some confusion on how to change delegate after completing all the steps in the airdrop process, so I made delegation.tools to make the process as easy as possible.","question_1":"This tool has provided value to the collective by enabling users to change their delegate easily. It has been used by ~13000 users since October 2022 (I don't have stats from before that), and has been shared on various socials (Twitter and YouTube). It is a very easy way to show users how to switch delegate. Stats are available here: https://plausible.io/delegation.tools","question_2":"My 9-to-5, plus grants","team":"1","OP Allocation":"23,641.12"}
