We need help to keep educating about Ethereum and Layer2 Optimism! :)","question_1":"We are a public good community where we teach about Web3 and we would love to share more about Optimism, because of low gas fees. In LATAM, we canâ€™t afford high gas fees, especially when we are using crypto for remittances. We are also bringing more women to become builders and founders, happy to use Optimism for their projects!","question_2":"For now, we partner and get sponsorship from different organizations, providing workshops, talks, hackathon preparation and organization, and event organization. We apply for different grants from protocols and projects.","team":"Core team: 5 people Contributors: 10 people","OP Allocation":"24,880.58"}
