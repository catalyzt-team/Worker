{"name":"Otterscan","twitter":"https://twitter.com/otterscan","github":"https://github.com/wmitsuda/otterscan","website":"https://otterscan.io/","about":"Otterscan is a self-hosted, fast, local, private, block explorer. It has a very small footprint, does not require installing additional DB, middleware, etc. It works together with your Erigon node. It relies only on onchain data and offline data sources. All custom information it needs from Erigon is available as custom APIs, so other dapp can make use of them too.","question_1":"Optimism will soon support Erigon as an execution client (that is public information) and when that happens, all Optimism users will benefit from having Otterscan as a self-hosted block explorer.","question_2":"We receive a small recurrent grant from Erigon team (enough to maintain 1 person team) and we have a gitcoin grant that help to cover extra expenses (buy test hardware, attend conferences, etc.) There are no investors or companies backing the project.","team":"1 person - Willian Mitsuda","OP Allocation":"68,834.84"}
