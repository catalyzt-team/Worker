{"name":"Nested","twitter":"https://twitter.com/nestedfi","github":"https://github.com/NestedFi","website":"https://nested.fi/","about":"The crypto world suffers from general over-complication and unbearable user experience that dissuade people from getting involved. Nested is a crypto trading/investing platform that breaks that trend by revolutionizing the accessibility to web3 in a way that is unprecedentedly simple, social and safe.","question_1":"Nested’s platform will make Optimism accessible to everyone around the world. As Layer 2 chains are attracting more and more users & liquidity, and as new Layer 1s emerge, it’s necessary for Optimism to maintain a high level of attractivity, possibility, and capital efficiency. Nested will be able to offer a unique UI/UX to onboard new users with a wide range of integrated DeFi solutions.","question_2":"We take a fee on every user's transaction between 0.3% and 0.8%, depending on the nature of the operation. For instance, if a user creates a custom index with 1000 USDC on Nested, there is a 0.3% fee (=3$). We also raised about $7.5M from the most renowned angel and institutional investors, including Jump, Alan Howard, Julien Bouteloup (Curve, Rekt, StakeDAO), Marc Zeller (Aave), DeFi Dad, etc.","team":"21 mainly based in the UK, France and Switzerland, including 13 developers.","OP Allocation":"8,663.52"}
