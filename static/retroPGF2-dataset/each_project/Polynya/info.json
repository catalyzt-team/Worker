I'm also a delegate for the Optimism Collective Token House and badgeholder-elect for the Citizen House.","question_1":"I've been writing about rollups since 2020, first Reddit, later on Medium, Twitter & Mirror. I have written over 100 blog posts about rollups, countless tweets and comments, with the sole focus of bridging the then vast information asymmetry around rollups & sustainable blockchain scalability. IMHO - job done on that front, so I'm semi-active now, but I suppose that's where \"retroactive\" comes in?","question_2":"My blog, twitter & writings are a hobby; my work is unrelated to crypto.","team":"1","OP Allocation":"98,824.31"}
