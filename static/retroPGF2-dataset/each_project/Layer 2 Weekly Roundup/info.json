{"name":"Layer 2 Weekly Roundup","twitter":"https://twitter.com/daddysether","github":"https://layer2roundup.substack.com/","website":"Null","about":"The Layer 2 Weekly Roundup is an educational weekly newsletter that provides a comprehensive roundup comprised of the most important user and developer updates from across Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem. The Layer 2 Weekly Roundup is a public good that is home to over 500 subscribers who utilize this resource to source high quality information from across multiple Layer 2 scaling protocols.","question_1":"This newsletter supports the OP stack by communicating high quality user and developer updates to the Optimism community, saving an immense amount of time that would otherwise require hours of research each week. These weekly roundups are especially useful to newer members of the crypto community who want to remain updated on the latest happening from across Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem.","question_2":"Right now the Layer 2 Weekly Roundup is run primarily as a public good for the purpose of providing free education to members of the Ethereum community. The Weekly Roundup does not generate any revenue as it is not currently sponsored, and is entirely free of charge. I sustain myself through my current full time role which is as a Community Manager at Scroll.","team":"The Layer 2 Weekly Roundup is a humble team of one :)","OP Allocation":"22,678.04"}
