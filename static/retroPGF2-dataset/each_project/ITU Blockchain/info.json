The mission of ITU Blockchain is primarily to increase blockchain literacy and awareness in its geography and to educate its community to develop qualified projects. With its nearly 3000 members, it organizes face-to-face and online educations and events every year.","question_1":"ITU Blockchain has helped many people wanting to improve themselves in this field by offering the first and only free Solidity training. It educates a wide audience on blockchain technology through the many trainings and events it organizes every year. It is a collective knowledge-sharing community that anyone in Turkey who wants to learn about blockchain can use.","question_2":"We are a community based entirely on voluntary work. Therefore, we have very few expenses. We can use the event spaces from the university by reserving them. To go to hackathons abroad, we make sponsorship agreements with some companies. The sponsorship money received from here is spent entirely on hackathon expenses.","team":"We have more than 70 active members working in the organization of events and educations. In total, there are nearly 3000 members who have become members of our community. Our face-to-face educations are generally held with 150-200 participants. We usually attend conferences and hackathons abroad with 8 hackers (2 teams of 4 people) and 3-4 participants.","OP Allocation":"26,447.32"}
