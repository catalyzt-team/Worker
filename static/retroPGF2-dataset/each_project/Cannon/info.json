{"name":"Cannon","twitter":"https://github.com/usecannon/cannon","github":"https://usecannon.com/","website":"Null","about":"Cannon is an 'Infrastructure as Code' tool (like Terraform) for Foundry and Hardhat. Users generate Cannonfiles instead of deploy scripts for a declarative approach to managing protocols, including upgrades and configuration. Deployment information can be shared on the registry (hosted on Ethereum and IPFS) to be used in other Cannonfiles and run for local testing and development.","question_1":"Cannon has already been used to deploy thousands of lines of code to Optimism and its testnet. As the modularity of the OP Stack will allow for the creation of more L2s and L3s, the ability to manage protocol deployments, upgrades, and configurations across many chains will become increasingly necessary. Cannon makes it trivial to scale protocol deployment across an arbitrary number of chains.","question_2":"The project is being incubated alongside the development of Synthetix V3, as we've needed to develop more generalized tooling based on lessons learned from maintaining the current version of Synthetix. Outside of a small prize from the ETH Denver 2022 Hackathon, where the project was conceived, the project has received no funding or revenue.","team":"Daniel Beal, Noah Litvin, Mat√≠as Lescano","OP Allocation":"90,241.42"}
