  "about": "ERC-4337 standardizes account abstraction on all EVM chains without the need for consensus-layer protocol changes. It defines a way to implement and use account abstraction on EVM chains, with a focus on L2. Our goal is to bring the 10X usability improvement that the ecosystem needs, to support the next billion users.",
  "question_1": "We developed the EIP and the implementation. A system that enable safe and decentralized access to contract accounts without relying on centralized infrastructure. Our work is used by a growing number of projects on OP and elsewhere. A future version will also use the OP Stack to offer native account abstraction and even better usability.",
  "question_2": "The work is supported by EF grants. There are no revenues. The project is 100% Public Good, built to improve the ecosystem.",
