{"Project Name":"Cannon","Project Website":"https://github.com/geohot/cannon","Project Lead Email":"george@comma.ai","Leader":"George Hotz","Question":"George is building an EVM equivalent fraud proof that can be used all across the Ethereum ecosystem. This will enable Optimistic Rollups to run the exact code written in Geth and even other client implementations which can compile down to MIPS. This would allow: \n1. Optimistic proofs of computation across any MIPS execution trace (truebit, already super useful);\n2. Optimistic proofs of Geth computation! This is what we need for the first generation of EVM equivalent rollups! Woot!","allocation":"4,890"}
