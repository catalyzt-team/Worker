{"Project Name":"Ipsilon","Project Website":"https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon","Project Lead Email":"alex@ethereum.org","Leader":"Alex Beregszaszi","Question":"The Ipsilon team is one of the most prolific contributors to virtual machines in the blockchain field, yet they are relatively unknown by the broader community.\n\nEarly on in the Ethereum 2.0, they researched different ideas in \"sharded execution\" and wrote some of first musings on \"cross-shard communication\". Many of these ideas have influenced how rollups communicate to each other and the roadmap for eth2.\n\nAdditionally, they developed the fastest EVM interpreter to date, evmone, a just-in-time compiler for EVM, and a fast, blockchain-focused WASM interpreter named Fizzy.\n\nMore recently, they have created a road map to evolve the EVM into a safer, more powerful platform. A few of the proposals in this suite:\n\n* EOF -- The Ethereum Object Format will allow backwards incompatible changes into the EVM. The potential of this is unlimited, but a few of their initial proposals will allow improved code analysis and reduce execution time.\n* EVM384 -- Native bignum operations that can be used to implement cryptographic primitives efficiently, without having to wait for a precompile.\n* Improved bounds on various aspects of the EVM to improve network safety and simplify some logic that relies on unbounded values.\n\nIpsilon has been a great contributor to the ecosystem for many years. A few hundred words can't account for all the ideas they've had or reviewed, nor the code they've written or reviewed. It's probably safe to say that some member of the team has thoroughly reviewed every EVM change since Spurious Dragon.\n\nI think they are as deserving as anyone to receive a retroPGF.","allocation":"20,782"}
