{"Project Name":"DAppNode","Project Website":"https://DAppNode.io","Project Lead Email":"edu@dappnode.io","Leader":"Eduardo Antuña Diez","Question":"Thread is here: https://twitter.com/DAppNode/status/1450390244759584768\n\n-----\n\n📖 Story Time! 📖 \n\n👵 The Origins of DAppNode ⛓️ 🚪 \n\nCC @optimismPBC for Retroactive Public Goods Funding Thread.\n\nIn 2017 @eduadiez @jbaylina @thegrifft realized people were using Web3 the same way the use Web2: \n\n\n1️⃣  Connect to a cloud hosted web\n2️⃣  Build transaction in @metamask\n3️⃣  Knock at the door of a Node-as-a-Service and ask them to broadcast your tx to some network you might not even know.\n\nHow is that different than knocking at facebook's door and ask them please if they would send our message to our friends?\n\nWe *have to* have some trust assumptions with web2, but with web3 we can *own* direct access to the networks we want to interact with. More on that later.\n\nAround the same time, @jbaylina witnessed the Spanish government censoring websites about a Catalan Independence Referendum - They could do it, and they did it! \n\n\nSurely there was a better way to not be at the mercy of the ones with power?\n\nThe breeding ground for @dappnode was at the perfect temperature and this is the brew that was in the 3 founder's heads:\n- Decentralized systems can provide people direct access to information and value transfer. \n\nIt's like connecting directly to The Matrix vs. using an endpoint controlled by the machines in one of the vats. \n\n\n- @IPFS  websites + @ensdomains and you have decentralized, uncensorable web hosting.\n\n- Plus all the advantages of decentralized value transmission systems (crypto), new organization models (DAOs), etc. \n\nThe catch? People need to *run nodes* to \"connect directly\" instead of via a centralizing party. \n\nLet me pause here and say that public endpoints are ✨  our saviours ✨  of course but going to the 🐈  cat cafe and owning a cat 🐱 have different rewards and responsibilities.\n\nSo: Why are people not running nodes?\n1. Needs certain technical knowledge (CLI might seem bread and butter to you, but UIs still rule the world)\n2. Needs dedicated hardware that runs 24/7 (getting out of sync and sync again is a pain, trust me)\n\n\nSo DAppNode was conceived as a way to help ANYONE, regardless of their technical level, be able to OWN their own access to the web3 to create a new, uncensorable infrastructure layer for a new internet. \n\n\n🤑  Free Open Source Software\n✨  Easy to use UI\n🍹   no maintenance (auto-updates)\n🪐  Fully built with decentralized tech (no central servers, or only opt-in services)\n🛠️  SDK for anyone to build on it\n\n\nFor the user, it gives them independence, self-sovereignty. And for the network, it has the added benefit to make it more resilient, by increasing the number of nodes in different setups, countries, ISPs, hardware... you name it.\n\nFor that we got a grant from the @ethereum foundation and @AragonProject - which kickstarted the project. \n\nSince then we've been helping people run nodes, eth2 validators, decentralized storage and websites and helping people OWN their web3 and provide friends and family with access to a new world. \n\nHow many people? That's a good question: we don't know and we don't want to know. We collect NO METRICS and have NO WAY TO KNOW who runs DAppNode. We sell plug-and-play DAppNode boxes, but we don't know how many people are running the software themselves in their own machine. \n\nNeedless to say, this is a no-go for traditional investors 😅 \n\nSo, to sum up: we're building a decentralized infrastructure layer for web3. We make Ethereum more resilient, increasing the amount of decentralized nodes. We empower people to have direct access to web3. We give tools to the home staker.\n#Infrastructure is a #PublicGood.","allocation":"9,780"}
