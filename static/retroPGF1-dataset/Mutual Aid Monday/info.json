{"Project Name":"Mutual Aid Monday","Project Website":"https://www.patreon.com/MutualAidMondayDen","Project Lead Email":"Jess.wiederholt@gmail.com","Leader":"Jessica Weiderholdt","Question":"Do you think about the people living on the streets - who don't have access to housing?  What about the ones in 1st world communities like in the USA?  Mutual Aid Monday (MAM) is a collective of people who act with compassion and no pay - to do the next right thing.  This includes providing nutritious meals with minimum waste, clothing, housing in the form of tents, building portable storage units and even moving from encampment to encampment at 2 am to make sure that the snowfall doesn't collapse tents used as housing - which would suffocate and kill the residents inside. MAM community helps people find working solutions to surviving homelessness while seeking to be sustainable and reducing the environmental footprint accentuated by a lack of physical structure.","allocation":"1,222"}
