{"Project Name":"WalletConnect","Project Website":"https://walletconnect.org/","Project Lead Email":"Gomes","Leader":"Pedro","Question":"Have you ever tried to use Rainbow on your favorite NFT platform? To swap tokens on Uniswap using Coinbase Wallet? All of these common behaviors we're seeing in this latest wave of web3 are only possible because of WalletConnect.\n\nWalletConnect is an open source protocol for connecting decentralized applications to mobile wallets with QR code scanning or deep linking. WalletConnect was started by Pedro Gomes in 2018, and still continues to be maintained almost solely by him even as we near the end of 2021.\n\nAs we move into this next phase of consumer adoption, we risk losing sight of the people who made everything we use possible. I have no doubt that Pedro is one of those people, and we should be proud to support him.","allocation":"40,342"}
