{"Project Name":"Wildcards","Project Website":"https://wildcards.world/","Project Lead Email":"jason@wildcards.world","Leader":"Jason Smythe","Question":"Wildcards is saving our planetâ€™s wildlife. @wildcards_world directly and transparently supports high impact conservation agencies working on the ground throughout Africa, North America, South America, and Asia. The platform breaks down traditional barriers to wildlife conservations biggest challenge, funding. It allows individuals and businesses to become a guardian of a unique wildcard NFTs that represents an animal a conservation agency protects in real life. When a guardian buys a wildcard, they must set the price they are willing to sell it for. Every month, the guardian of the wildcard gives a specified portion of the price they are willing to sell that wildcard for, to the conservation agency that helps conserve that animal. At any point, someone can buy the wildcard from them, if they are willing to pay the selling price that was specified because wildcards are always for sale. When someone buys the wildcard, they must set a selling price. The new guardian of the wildcard is then responsible for giving the new monthly donation. And so, the cycle continues the generation of funds for the conservation agencies. Guardians stand to make a profit when their wildcard is bought from them, contribute transparently to wildlife conservation, and display their wildcard NFT artwork. Having already raised over 130,000 USD for 30 conservation agencies since its inception a year and a half ago, Wildcards works and @optimismPBC retroactive public goods funding would enable it to scale, build fiat on-ramps, and channel more funding to more hands-on high impact conservation efforts on the ground.","allocation":"6,112"}
