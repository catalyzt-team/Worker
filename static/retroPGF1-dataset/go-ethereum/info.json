{"Project Name":"go-ethereum","Project Website":"https://geth.ethereum.org/","Project Lead Email":"idk","Leader":"Péter Szilágyi (?) (or the EF?)","Question":"Since the Optimism team worked together with the Ethereum community to create and host the first Geth Workshop at EthCC 2021, it was apparent that the go-ethereum team is in need of a lot of support from the broader Ethereum community so that geth can continue to be relied upon as critical infrastructure. Thus, this nomination is made in the hope if the geth team were to receive RPGF, they will use it to improve the team's and software's resilience -- e.g. hosting more workshops, hiring more engineers, offering resources for students/learners, hosting hackathons, etc.","allocation":"45,232"}
