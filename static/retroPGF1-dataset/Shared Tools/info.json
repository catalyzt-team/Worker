{"Project Name":"Shared Tools","Project Website":"https://www.sharedtools.org/","Project Lead Email":"hi@kaustav.me","Leader":"Chimera","Question":"This project is super useful! It helps anyone deploy detailed smart contracts based on ERC 20, ERC721 using a friendly UI. They also provide vote Escrow UI among other fantastic tools. Other pros include:\n\n- UI for those who don't want to use scripts to deploy contracts\n- Easy to follow controls\n- Save time and money on audits using templated farming contract, vote escrow, nft deployer factories\n- Plug and play UI for vote escrow tokens\n- Opens up the opportunity to write smart contract to a wider public\n- Active development on OVM implementations\n- A little bit of love might help the devs develop this into a full-scale mainnet tool as well","allocation":""}
