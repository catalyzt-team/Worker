{"Project Name":"C4","Project Website":"www.thec4coin.com","Project Lead Email":"Wealth@TheC4Coin.com","Leader":"Michael Anderson","Question":"Black businesses earn 1/20th the American average, and Black founders receive less than 1% of VC/PE money. C4 is spearheading a marketplace where capital meets Black businssses with a DeFi component that puts capital and introduces The West’s most neglected group of people into the most critical opportunity from which to create egalitarian outcomes. The US government reneged on a commitment to fund such a FinTech project focused on democratizing access to capital and contracts for “Minority Business Development—of which participation covers around 1%. After putting in the work, the Government failing to commit left  the founders stranded. Such is the history of America and it’s Black population. From the inception, leaders promised freedom yet Blacks possess as much wealth in 2020 as they did in 1865, around 1%. Blockchain gave the team a way to create instant liquidity, so that they might transfer to experience honed in catalyzing economic development for underserved and underrepresented groups in a DeFi investment and tokenization platform focused on leveling the playing field. Entrepreneurship is freedom, and crypto is the path to liberation. American ideals and principles will only be made real when technological innovation focused on increasing access to cutting edge liquidity generation is deliberate and intentional in including Black Indigenous People of Color. Culture x capital = community change, hence C4 is the future of DeFi in color. Thank you for your commitment to create more egalitarian outcomes with reverberations for the entire world.","allocation":"4,890"}
