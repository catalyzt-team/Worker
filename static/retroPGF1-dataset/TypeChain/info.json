{"Project Name":"TypeChain","Project Website":"https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain","Project Lead Email":"chris@kaczor.io","Leader":"Chris Kaczor","Question":"Who is not using Typescript these days?! Everyone is! And TypeChain is a must have if you are developing Typescript based Dapps. It's an awesome project, that is included in the default stack of every Dapp these days. It's working fine and no one is talking about it, but it deserves a lot of love and appreciation!","allocation":"14,670"}
