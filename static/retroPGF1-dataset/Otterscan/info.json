{"Project Name":"Otterscan","Project Website":"https://github.com/wmitsuda/otterscan","Project Lead Email":"wmitsuda@gmail.com","Leader":"Willian Mitsuda","Question":"Otterscan is the most affordable way for regular people to run a mainnet block explorer locally. Since everything is local, everything is fast, private, and it runs on consumer grade hardware.\n\nIt is built on top of Erigon, currently the only ETH client able to run an archive node on consumer grade hardware (syncs in < 1 week, takes ~1.5 TB; regular external SSDs do the work).\n\nOtterscan implements some non-standard JSON-RPC methods as Erigon patches to extract additional information (e.g. internal ETH transfers) directly from Erigon DB.\n\nThen, we use this data with other public datasets (4bytes, Sourcify) to provide a 100% local block explorer. It is a SPA and requires only a patched, synced Erigon archive node, no additional middleware (SQL DBs, indexers) is necessary.\n\nIt supports open standards like ENS, and widespread sources of info like Chainlink for getting historical price info directly from the archive, no external sources are needed.\n\nCommunity members have even made it available into a dappnode package.","allocation":"8,557"}
