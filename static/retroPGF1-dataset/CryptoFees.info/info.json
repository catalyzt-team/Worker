{"Project Name":"CryptoFees.info","Project Website":"https://cryptofees.info","Project Lead Email":"david@dmihal.com","Leader":"David Mihal","Question":"CryptoFees (and other sites in the CryptoStas family like OpenOrgs, MoneyMovers, etc) provide trustworthy, unbiased metrics about various crypto protocols. All sites are open-source, and all data is sourced from open data providers such as the Graph Protocol. As part of building CryptoFees, we contribute to many existing subgraphs (such as Uniswap V3) and build new subgraphs (such as the Optimism fees subgraph).\n\nReceiving retroactive public-good funding will allow myself and the other contributors to the project to continue adding new protocols to our sites and exploring new metrics that we can share with the rest of the crypto community.","allocation":"22,005"}
