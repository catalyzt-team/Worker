{"Project Name":"Hive","Project Website":"https://github.com/ethereum/hive","Project Lead Email":"felix@ethereum.org","Leader":"Felix Lange","Question":"Hive has caught several bugs in nethermind and geth (https://github.com/ethereum/hive#trophies) and is actively maintained by Felix and others from the geth team, including Martin H Swende and now Jared Wasinger. This is an extremely important test suite for possible future client implementors to check behaviour/spec conformance and is an important component of the ethereum CI pipeline, results can be viewed here: https://hivetests.ethdevops.io/. Hive will likely also be repurposed to support eth2 in the future.","allocation":"31,785"}
