{"Project Name":"Revoke.cash","Project Website":"revoke.cash","Project Lead Email":"rosco@kalis.me","Leader":"Rosco Kalis","Question":"Rosco has created a way to safely track and remove erc20 and NFT allowances from your wallets.  He enables ethereum users to have an easy way to scan their wallets for potentially malicious allowances.  This is critical for keeping our wallets safe.  It is highly likely that past mysterious wallet \"hacks\" have been engineered through past unlimited allowances. I regularly check my wallet address allowances through the revoke.cash site to make sure I haven't left any attack surfaces open. Access is free and Rosco is the best for coding this for the ethereum community.  Go Rosco!!","allocation":"3,667"}
