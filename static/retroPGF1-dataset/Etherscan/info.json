{"Project Name":"Etherscan","Project Website":"etherscan.io","Project Lead Email":"matt@etherscan.io","Leader":"Matthew Tan","Question":"Etherscan is definitely the most undervalued platform we have out there. They have been giving out excellent service most of the time but not charging most of the users anything! They might make money from ads and API Pro service but I believe they need more funds to continue providing crypto world with amazing data and details that we might not get from other explorer. Etherscan is definitely a God's gift from Heaven!","allocation":"24,450"}
