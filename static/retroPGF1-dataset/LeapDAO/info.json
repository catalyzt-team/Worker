{"Project Name":"LeapDAO","Project Website":"https://github.com/leapdao","Project Lead Email":"johannbarbie@me.com","Leader":"Johann Barbie (formely) & Kosta Korenkov","Question":"LeapDAO is a collective that formed around the idea of creating a minimal viable plasma implementation in the beginning of 2019.\n\nFrom the start, our governance structure has consisted of a mixture of Gnosis Multisigs and an engaged Holocratic process [1]. \n\n\"Gardeners\", \"Reviewers\" and \"Workers\" collaborated via Slack and GitHub [2] to build one of the first MVP Plasma implementations on Tendermint. We shipped to the Ethereum Rinkeby test network [3]. \n\nLeapDAO members actively participated in the Plasma \"Implementer Calls\" [4, 15] and contributed meaningfully with proposals to the ethresear.ch online forum [5, 6]. \n\nWe, the underwriters, believe that particularly the work around solEVM and LeapDAO founder Johann's post on \"_Why Smart Contracts are NOT feasible on Plasma_\" [6] deserve more recognition as they've informed the future work on Optimism's OVM and rollups [7].\n\nWhile developing Plasma, LeapDAO members engaged in numerous other meaningful activites. We organized a quadratic voting session (\"popup democracy\") at the Volt Deutschland party congress [8]. At cccamp and ETH Berlin Zwei, we deployed \"Planet A\" - a \"serious social game\"[9, 10] to educate on the adverserial effects of the tragedy of the commons.\n\nLeapDAO's .org domain is currently down. Shit happens. We're trying to fix it. But all LeapDAO contributions and token equity have been recorded by the LeapDAO treasury [11]. Through this record, we believe that LeapDAO is uniquely setup to receive retroactive funding by e.g. airdropping rewards to all LEAP token holders [12].\n\nLeapDAO members have since then moved onto other projects in the Ethereum space. 0xhabitat.org is improving governance and runs on a domain-specific rollup called NutBerry [13]. Strudel.finance's aim was to limit Bitcoin's incumbency and CO2 emissions. rugpullindex.com improves AMM staking safety. Social Dist0rtion Protocol has renamed themselves to \"*Social Distancing* Protocol\". EthereumMachineOracle is a spiritual successor of solEVM [14]. Whiterabbit.one aims to decentralize movie streaming and reduce piracy the gentle way. And sushi is delicious, especially when it *flow*s.\n\nMore than anything, with this application, we, the ones that haven't managed to deploy our work onto the Ethereum mainnet, seek to find attribution and recognition for the countless hours and sleepless nights spent on contributing to open source and the Ethereum ecosystem. Hence, we'd love to get retroactive funding for our work.\n\nSigned,\nThe LeapDAO team\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/YMupQQ22ky\n\n### References\n\n- 1: https://app.glassfrog.com/organizations/14849/orgnav/roles/10883348\n- 2: https://github.com/leapdao/meta/blob/05e1570c7fac1a097efaae4f7aab4426be3ca2b3/fundingProposals/Template%20-%20Funding%20Proposal.md\n- 3: https://github.com/leapdao/meta/blob/master/playbook/operations/testnet/README.md#contracts\n- 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTKCmYB6ntA\n- 5: https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-leap-a-state-enabled-computing-model-for-plasma/3539\n- 6: https://ethresear.ch/t/why-smart-contracts-are-not-feasible-on-plasma/2598\n- 7: https://github.com/leapdao/solEVM-enforcer\n- 8: https://twitter.com/leapdao/status/1169921680317341696?s=20\n- 9: https://www.dist0rtion.com/2019/09/18/planet-a-ccc-ethberlin-recap/\n- 10: https://medium.com/ethberlin/introducing-planet-a-the-tragedy-of-the-co%E2%82%82mmons-90e35c229475\n- 11: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SvvfFPNFXntJTOWhHn_-Qj-11IM3qUWosjn6w5aXMlo/edit\n- 12: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78230e69d6e6449db1e11904e0bd81c018454d7a\n- 13: https://ethresear.ch/t/nutberry-smart-contracts-on-layer-2/6126\n- 14: https://github.com/leapdao/EthereumMachineOracle/\n- 15: https://plasma.io/plasma-contracts.html","allocation":"7,335"}
