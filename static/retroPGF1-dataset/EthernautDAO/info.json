{"Project Name":"EthernautDAO","Project Website":"https://forum.ethernautdao.io/","Project Lead Email":"palebluedot@gmail.com","Leader":"Alejandro Santander","Question":"EthernautDAO is the consolidation of numerous non-profit efforts made during the past few years to produce educational content like the Ethernaut CTF game, the Ethernaut diaries, and more, into a community that can proliferate this concept of educating because... well, because it's fun! The EthernautDAO has a lot of plans for the near future, and would certainly enjoy a bit of community recognition and help. Our goal is to transform web2 devs into web3 devs in a mere instant, and grow the Ethereum dev community by aligning incentives in a gamified way. We've  trained about a dozen devs so far with zero resources, and have even succeeded in getting most of them hired by web3 teams. We need some help  to scale this process exponentially.","allocation":"14,670"}
