{"Project Name":"Blockchain Education Network (BEN)","Project Website":"blockchainedu.org","Project Lead Email":"erick@blockchainedu.org","Leader":"Erick Pinos","Question":"Blockchain Education Network is focused on educating the next generation of crypto professionals. Their partnership with over 300 blockchain clubs has brought a ton of value to its student partners. Specifically, \n\n- free courses and workshops to teach students Solidity and dapp development\n- free support, including flights, airbnbs, and visas, for students to attend Ethereum & blockchain hackathons\n- free guidance counseling and connections for students looking for jobs in the space\n- free mentorship and resources for students to start and grow blockchain clubs at their universities around the world\n\nI highly recommend BEN and believe they will put the retroactive resources to good use - always focused on the student and their education and onboarding into blockchain.","allocation":"1,222"}
