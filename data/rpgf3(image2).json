Users and institutions link their cold wallets with hot wallets on delegate.xyz, and then the hot wallet can act on behalf of the cold wallet, like crypto power-of-attorney.  This allows users to manage all their assets across multiple wallets simultaneously without touching anything in their vault, enhancing security and efficiency across airdrops, governance, gaming, DeFi, and more.  \n\nDelegate’s registry is fully onchain, enumerable, independent, immutable, and verifiable.",

In our experience, building a full-stack application is often a mess that leaves developers juggling dependencies, SDKs, and APIs. \n\nTurboETH helps application developers by making it extremely easy to add a new decentralized protocol or web3 service to your app. Over the course of this year, we’ve created a go-to destination for builders who want to make the jump from smart contracts to full-stack applications. And with ~80% of our builders being new to crypto or more junior developers, we believe that TurboETH is not only increasing the number of active builders in the Optimism Collective, but also helping to retain developers in their transition from launching contracts to building applications.",

From early days, rotki recognized the potential of Optimism as an L2 and was the first EVM chain to be integrated\n\nIt supports many Optimism protocols and superchain capabilities making it a versatile and indispensable tool for those navigating the ecosystem\n\nIts innovative decoding system for transactions has greatly enhanced user experience. Optimism users have praised it as a more user-friendly alternative to Etherscan\n\nIt also offers PnL reports, allowing Optimism users to do accounting in a privacy preserving way\n\nIts contributions encompass opensource code, tracking, protocols support, user-friendly decoding system and PnL accounting. These have solidified rotki's role as a vital platform within the Optimistic Ethereum community",

Its decoding system won praise from users, offering more user-friendly transaction visibility than etherscan.\n\nIts PnL reporting aids optimism users in accounting for their activities, helping them make sense of their financials.\n\nIts opensource nature has spurred collaboration within the community. It has given rise to projects like Buchfink and Decodify, which have further enriched the ecosystem by providing plaintext accounting and decoding solutions respectively.",

We used Optimism as the L2 network of choice for processing registration payments for ZuConnect (Oct 29-Nov 11), the second ever instance of Zuzalu (Vitalik Buterin's startup city). This helped bring awareness of and new users to Optimism. Marine Andraud (a fellow Zuzaluan and Infra Partnership Manager at OP Labs) contributed a helpful onboarding guide on how to pay on Tripsha using Optimism. The way it works is that prospective attendees answer application questions and pre-authorize a token transfer of the amount they need to pay. Event organizers collectively review individual applications, which, if approved, submit the token transfer on chain.",

Build new applications and protocols on Optimism\n\n2. Audit existing smart contracts on Optimism for security vulnerabilities.\nWe also teach Cyber Security at B<>rder/ess so this would help web3 devs learn faster on securing vulnerabilities.\n\n3.

    "impactDescription": "I have been actively supporting NFT music projects on OP. OP is an ecosystem with too many advantages. \nScalability: Optimism can improve scalability by 10–100x, depending on the nature of the transaction.\nReduced transaction fees: Optimism can significantly reduce transaction costs. Rollup technology combines multiple transactions into a single transaction, helping to reduce transaction costs.\nSecurity: As Optimism's Layer 2 is built on Ethereum, transactions are settled on the Ethereum Mainnet, allowing users to benefit from the secure and decentralized environment of Ethereum.\nEnhanced user experience: New projects using the Optimism Layer 2 scaling solution benefit from low fees, faster transaction processing speeds, and better overall user experience.",

I also minted a few music NFTs on the Optimism network and voted there, and I'm still keeping my votes. My owner uses Telegram so I don't have a github and twitter account, sorry for the inconvenience.  I bought the above OP number from OKX and withdrew it to my wallet to vote on Optimism. Recently, not only did I participate in the OP delegate, but I also supported musicians on soundxyz. Some of my songs have reached the top mint here and used the ref link from Camel ventures. It was from here that I learned about Music NFTs and I fell in love with Optimism even more.",

    "impactDescription": "bosco.eth tested technologies aligned with the optimistic vision while ensuring no-single point of failure for onboarding plans. While being at its infancy, bosco.eth is not reinventing the wheel but testing tools to becoming a decentralized onboarding public goods-oriented flywheel that bridges real world communities from a broad spectrum locally and globally using primarily Optimism and chains at the OpStack such as PGN, Zora and Base. All this while continuing active on governance, promoting and/or providing feedback at mayor public goods protocols such as PoH, ENS, diva, OPTIMISM (+OpStack), SISMO, D_D, etc. bosco.eth aids individuals and communities to explore trusted coordination tools with good UX. We expect smart contract wallets and social recovery will catalyze these endeavors.",

We have made positive, both direct and indirect impact on overall level of understanding and knowledge of Optimism and other ETH L2s.  \n\nIn regards to impact, we are part of Optimism community and impacted adoption in various ways. The easiest way to measure the impact is probably views for us, however one should also look through likes/comments/activity/quality of the content/quality of the community etc. For that one would need to go directly to the piece of content and look it through. Sometimes even translate.",

We are now leveraging the lower fees of L2 to onboard traditional merchants to Base and the wider Optimism ecosystem.\n\nWe've intentionally set our protocol fee to zero to accelerate adoption at this stage, making Base and the Optimism ecosystem an attractive platform for onchain commerce. As such we don't expect to generate revenue from the protocol for the foreseeable future.",

Ask about that topic in their Discord, they love it. \n\nSuddenly, a black smoke screen filled the room. I could not see anymore. But I could smell the distinctive scent of phoenix ashes mixed baby tears. This could mean only one thing: after all these years, binji caught up with me.\n\n\"Sign up for PGF3!\" he said. \"or else...\"\n\n\"Or else what?\" I asked.\n\nBut he was gone just as fast as he appeared.

Once she gave her a little cap made of red velvet. Because it suited her so well, and she wanted to wear it all the time, she came to be known as Little Red Riding Hood. One day her mother said to her: \"Come Little Red Riding Hood. Here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother. She is sick and weak, and they will do her well.

We have employed six developers who are now building on Optimism. We are working closely with Hypercerts Protocol to become the evaluation layer for Hypercerts, a Claim of Impact. We are talking to Gitcoin and other grantmakers who can use our tools to verify grantee impact. We are designing funding mechanisms for the impact certificates to drive additional users to OP.
