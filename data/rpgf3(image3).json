Optimism is a mental attitude characterized by hope and confidence in success and a positive future. Optimists tend to view hardships as learning experiences or temporary setbacks. Even the most miserable day holds the promise for them that “tomorrow will probably be better.” Optimists expect good things to happen, whereas pessimists instead predict unfavorable outcomes. Optimistic attitudes are linked to several benefits, including better coping skills, lower stress levels, better physical health, and higher persistence when pursuing goals",

The Optimism Collective is a group of companies, communities, and citizens working together to reward public goods and build a sustainable future for Ethereum. The collective aims to dispel the myth that public goods cannot be profitable by deploying a new model for rewarding those who create or sustain public goods - retroactive public goods funding (RetroPGF) - to support projects and communities building for the common good. RetroPGF is advantageous because it is relatively easy to agree on what is useful and see who built it. It is a lot harder to identify in advance what will be useful and which team will do the best job of building it.",

Web2 community social platforms like Reddit provide online solutions for communities to create and interact. However, all data generated on the platform including content, activities, and social graphs do not belong to users. This lack of data ownership creates strong censorship and locks users in the moat the platform built to generate revenue for the company stakeholders. We propose a solution to address this web2 data ownership problem, as well as a novel in-community reputation system to boost contribution, foster community growth, and facilitate community management.",

I won’t go into the details of why we finally pulled the trigger, but it made sense to have more control of our home environment.\n\nWhen the box arrived, I was excited. I felt like I was stepping into the future. Once I got it all wired up and began the setup, though, my original hesitation came flooding back.\n\nNest would like to use your location.\n\nI almost bailed. This is when Nest stopped feeling like a fun, helpful device and started to feel like an intrusive portal. Yet another keyhole for a company (or whomever else) to peer into my family’s life. It was probably okay, I rationalized. It’s probably just sharing location and temperature data, I thought to myself.",

Likewise, using the Zora platform allowed us to share the work of our aynicinos in the creation of NFTs.  In the future, we plan to continue using web3 technology to educate children and youth in Peru\nThe influence of optimism on children and young people has been notable, providing them with invaluable access to educational resources and opportunities.",

I'm Audi from Thailand, now I'm doing \"Jolden Crypto\" both on Facebook and Twitter and previously I do \"Illuvium Thailand\" which is a Facebook fanpage of GameFi called Illuvium.\n\nWhen I start doing Jolden Crypto, most of my content below will focus to lead Thai users and retail liquidity into Lyra protocol in early stage (around October 2021) to help Optimism ecosystem growth organically and as known more from Thai crypto space. \n\nI'm in love with everything about Ethereum ecosystem, so I have a little bit deep dive article too. Not all of my deep dive article is related to Optimism, but I hope that those article can lead \"real\" users into Ethereum and also some DApps on Optimism ecosystem.",

At that time, Thai developer community introducing me to know about Optimism.\n\nThai crypto space didn't know about Optimism ecosystem that much, along with I love a vision of Optimism about making impact to crypto space. So I decide to create Optimism content and have a goal to bring Thai users to know more about Optimism and DApps on Optimism.",

Which allowed for an RPG type game to thrive with over 300+ NFTs to find as loot.\n\nBehind Lorak is LandTorn is a gaming hub built on Optimisim Base, acting as a publisher and distributor of games with a focus on on-chain innovation.

While I may not be a developer, I am trying to use influence and high quality content, including relationship building, to bring a greater awareness of crypto around the world. And I believe it's a good work we can do across the board to better us as a society. \n\nI'll be continuing to do that with our without help but I sure would love help and support along the way so I'm trying to make a statement for that here.",

Working closely with @FA40Ziv, as one of only two moderators in his Discord community, I've guided both new and experienced members, making Optimism accessible to all.\n\nAs a devoted father of a newborn, I'm driven to promote scalable solutions in the blockchain space. The Optimism network's OP Mainnet, built by Ethereum developers, provides a fast, stable, and cost-effective L2 blockchain. Its EVM-equivalent architecture ensures seamless scalability for Ethereum applications. I believe this is the future!",

In the recent OP airdrop of September 2023, I not only received OP, but I also used this opportunity to underscore the significance of governance engagement.\n\nFirmly believing that true impact arises from active involvement, I continuously encourage the members within Discord to take part in governance. By sharing direct links to votes and urging everyone to appoint delegates, I've strived to create an atmosphere of genuine participation.\n\nThis isn't merely about holding tokens, but rather, about wielding influence and shaping Optimism's trajectory collectively. I'm committed to driving Optimism's adoption and RetroPGF support will play a pivotal role in achieving this goal.",

We deeply investigated and produced documentation around all of the viable paths for expanding Token House governance across the Superchain and ultimately recommended a zk-SNARK based approach that scales to thousands of chains and millions of users.",

Furnish it\n\nOnce completed, the property joins our rental program, generating income for investors. With our housing background, investors should recoup their investment by year 5.\n\nAfterward, we sell the home and share the profits. Investors can also use the property, akin to a timeshare but without pesky fees. This property pays you back over time, and we never charge maintenance fees.",
