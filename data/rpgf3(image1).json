Obviously, this prevented a serious consensus bug between geth client and the rest of the clients. London hard fork also contained the EIP1559 implementation - change in the fee mechanism for Ethereum.\nI also had contributions to rust web3 library widely used for all rust projects on ethereum and EVM compatible chains and also contributed to Cowswap project which main impact is protecting users from MEV and giving best prices.",

It is relevant for any protocol or DApp aiming for a successful token network. In this early stage of the field, it’s a problem for projects to find the right experts, and it’s challenging for token engineers to acquire and prove expertise. \nSince October 2022, TE Academy has built a comprehensive study program for aspiring token engineers available as a public good, and brought TE to major crypto events. Today, more than 3000 students are building their professional careers with NFT proofs on Optimism.

Available as of Oct 11th 2024.\n\nThis contribution is two-fold.\n\n1. It allows a user to set an IPFS gateway to use for IPFS URLs (ipfs:// and ipns://). If a local node is installed and running, curl will try and find it's configured gateway without any additional user configuration.\n\n2. It translates IPFS URLs internally to the defined (or detected) gateway thus giving the user a smooth IPFS usage experience without them ever seeing the gateway part of a URL.\n\nThese additions to CURL make it accept the IPFS URLs without the need to prefix them with a gateway (a central point of entry).",

Ideally you want the user to specify just the IPFS parts, the gateway needs to be a configuration. The changes made in curl 8.4.0 do exactly that. Users can now use an IPFS URL like this:\ncurl ipfs://bafybeigagd5nmnn2iys2f3doro7ydrevyr2mzarwidgadawmamiteydbzi\n\nThe gateway is effectively reduced to a configuration detail. Users of curl now don't need to share the gateway anymore and can instead use plain simple IPFS URLs.\n\nCURL is estimated to be installed at ~20 billion places making this a potential huge impact for IPFS adoption and another step in a more distributed world.",

In addition, these calls have helped transition many delegates from new to active-and-contributing by being the go-to place for onboarding.

Furthermore, as Autonomous Worlds they are a test bed for the technical and governance structures required for a future of ownerless, composable applications.\n\nPlaymint's work on Client Side Proofs was released as a public good and shared with other teams in the space. Since the time of its release the idea of running proofs on clients has been considered a practical possibility.",

Our native protocol liquidity is wBLT-BMX, demonstrating that wBLT can be paired with any asset and continue to earn wBLT rewards. wBLT can also be collateralized. LPing is inherently complex, to support user education, we intentionally named our liquidity after a sandwich, for the meme and for the concept of multiple ingredients (assets) combined to form one sandwich (token).

Liquidity providers of protocols like Yearn Finance and Ethos Reserve have deployed wBLT-YFI and wBLT-stERN liquidity pools on Velocimeter. Instead of pairing wETH-YFI or USDC-stERN, wBLT allows bluechip capital to be put to work and earn additional revenue for the LP/protocol in addition to pool2 rewards. wBLT as a paired asset composed of multiple bluechips and stablecoins may also reduce single-asset price volatility risk.

The tool kit is free and open source and able to audit mechanism design which has historically been challenging. The tool is also able to model risk across many stochastic processes and historical data. The EVM logic simulator has been used to find critical vulnerabilities in the Portfolio smart contract system that auditors were previously unable to identify. Because of the tools speed and EVM execution parity, it allows for unparalleled quality and quantity of testing data for any smart contract system or application. As optimism maintains support for the EVM execution environment and is an extensive smart contract system, tooling across to ecosystem to help improve safety and security is paramount. ",

Many of the people we talked to told us that they were surprised to learn that such a “web2” like UX was already possible to achieve! Apps that bridge the knowledge gap between web2 and web3 are necessary for mass adoption — we just wanted to create a really fun LLM app while using crypto as the infrastructure, and we succeeded in doing so.\n\nWe also wanted to share just how great our developing experience was with other builders so we did a quick demo at the first Base Builders community session. We hope that other developers were inspired by our work!",

We co-hosted the event with Bartek of L2BEAT, who kindly shared his wealth of knowledge with our audience about Optimism including computational requirements, scaling models, and RPGF as a community engagement and ecosystem growth tool.\n\nThe second piece expanded on the initial conversation by exploring the OP stack and the projects that are using it. We had three different projects that use the OP stack to build: Mantle, Metis and Goshen. Each provided tons of insights about why they chose Optimism, and encouraged listeners to start building on OP.",

This extends to other onchain actions such as signing up for an account, recovering an account, and paying for storage.

In the last year we've had over 22M NFTs minted on OP like drops with partners including Optimism, World Coin, Conduit, Base, and more. We didn't have any fee collection on for almost all of these mints. \n\nWe also built a product called The Box that enables 1-click transactions from any token on any chain - meaning that users can make transactions on Optimism (or other L2s) without needing native tokens on Optimism and we do all the bridging and swapping in the background at the Point of Sale (or Point of Transaction). This has already brought a few thousand transactions to Optimism and been integrated to enable payment for NFTs",

Web3 Talks: a podcast where top crypto founders take us on a backstage tour and explain how they built their projects. It has 48 episodes so far, incl. interviews with founders of ZORA, WalletConnect, Farcaster, Zapper, Gnosis & many more.\n\n2. Goldmine3: Listeners asked me for a way to browse through stories & tactics shared on the podcast, so I built a searchable repo of real web3 case studies.\n\n3. Product communications guide: As I've spoken with 100+ crypto founders, I found they find it hard to explain what their products do. So I wrote a guide with 40 examples of good & bad practices.\n\n4.

So I open-sourced it.\n\nSince the podcast is focused on niche, tactical know-how, it only had a bit more than 1,500 subscribers. My guide also had a bit more than 1,000 readers.

E2PG connects to Ethereum by 1 of 3 ways: JSON RPC API, full node file system (fast), or using RLPS (slower than full node but faster than JSON RPC).\n\nRLPS is an HTTP API that delivers compressed RLP data for: blocks, transactions, and logs designed specifically for indexers. Index Supply hosted RLPS runs on many chains including the following OP L2s: 10, 420, 8453, and 84531. Index Supply operates a full nodes (op-geth, op-node) for each hosted RLPS API.",

Since then we've made it dead simple to boot up an E2PG indexer and have it be connected to Optimism and Base to start indexing data across those chains. To my knowledge, E2PG + RLPS is the quickest way to get data from multiple L2 chains into a Postgres database. I don't believe any of the hosted API providers are as easy to setup or are as fast as RLPS to index historical data.",

The learning topics included protocols in the defi, NFTs, bridges, wallets, onramp, and tools categories. The program produced around 400 power users of the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nWe were also invited by Coinbase to produce an artwork that was featured as part of the Coinbase wallet quests. This initiative provided a large net positive in helping onboard 25,000 Coinbase Wallet users onto Optimism, creating a positive impact on the entire Optimism system.\n",

SoP aims to give the OP Collective the tools to get better at the latter. \n\nSoP is also a way for the Ethereum community to engage with experts outside of blockchain that want to also better understand protocols for their domain of interest, and build bridges with communities we may otherwise not be able to.
